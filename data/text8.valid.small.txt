currently costing mxn two around eur zero one three or usd zero one nine a number of stations display pre columbian artifacts and architecture that was discovered during the metro s construction however the metro reaches only a fraction of the total inhabited area of the city and therefore an extensive network of bus routes has been implemented these are mostly managed by private companies which are allowed to operate buses as long as they adhere to certain minimal service quality standards the city government also operates a network of large buses in contrast with the privately operated microbuses with fares barely exceeding that of the metro electric transport other than the metro also exists in the form of trolleybuses and the xochimilco light rail line the city s first

iata airport code mex it has four major bus stations north south observatorio tapo with bus service to cities across the country and one train station used for commercial purposes intercity passenger

several other major cities the city does not have an expressway network that connects points within the city all cross city trips must be done on arterial roads this is one reason why the city s streets are so congested urban problems as one of the largest urban areas in the world mexico city suffers from no shortage of the problems common to many large cities including traffic poverty and pollution this is perhaps exacerbated by mexico s developing country status this city has a high number of street children some estimate as many as five zero zero zero zero the mountains and volcanoes surrounding the city trap polluted air in the city and contribute to the city s serious problem with poor air quality although major strides have been made to improve the pollution situation in the past two zero years violent crime is also a major concern in two zero zero three mexico had the second highest number of kidnappings in the world with some three zero zero zero reported cases in taxis a particular problem has arisen individuals are sometimes kidnapped by unauthorized taxi drivers in order to empty their bank accounts at atms victims are sometimes kept overnight in order to bypass daily withdrawal limits inside other transportation mostly microbuses pickpocketing is still a common activity and mexico city inhabitants take various levels of precaution to avoid being victims of this police reform has also been a focus of the government for the past decade there is a general sense of distrust against the authorities as conventional wisdom holds that all mexico s police forces

independence monument in the heart of mexico city at night due to its special situation as the home of the federal government the local government of mexico city has gone through several incarnations since independence the city sometimes had an independent local government and other times the greater part of the two zero th century was administered directly by the president of the republic who delegated his authority to a head of the federal district department known more tersely as the regent this kind of political organization caused much resentment among the inhabitants of the city because for many years they were deprived of a government that properly represented them the most serious situation arose in one nine eight eight when people from mexico city clearly voted for opposition candidates despite which they were ruled for six years by the party that won the federal presidency under these circumstances political reform became inevitable first a local legislative assembly was established and people were able to elect their head of government jefe de gobierno for the first time both institutions still had limited powers dependent on the federal congress and president the first elected head of government was cuauht moc c rdenas a former presidential candidate who was according to many cheated out of victory in the closely fought one nine eight eight presidential election c rdenas resigned later to compete in the two zero zero zero presidential campaign and left in his place rosario robles who became the first woman to govern mexico city a measure of the democratic development in mexico is that the current two zero zero zero zero six chief of government in the federal district is andr s manuel l pez obrador of the prd which has an left leaning

was impeached because he failed to obey a judge s order to stop a road from being built this event is popularly called the desafuero this issue created a political crisis which was resolved by the judiciary s ultimate decision to refrain from prosecuting l pez obrador on july two nine two zero zero five l pez obrador resigned and left office to be able to run for the presidency in two zero zero

largely determined by one s political preferences the city is colloquially known as chilangolandia after their locals nickname the chilangos some natives of mexico city dislike that nickname although it has been fully adopted by the hippest young urban classes some argue that the term chilango refers to campesinos who have come to mexico city looking for employment the distrito federal has also

body with hints of berry plum and currant most connoisseurs consider it easy to drink when compared to other red wines particularly its traditional blending partner cabernet sauvignon its softness and fleshiness combined with its earlier ripening makes merlot an ideal grape to blend with the sterner later ripening cabernet many merlots are made in a style popular with newer red wine drinkers though good merlots accompanying appropriate food are popular with many more experienced wine drinkers as well merlot is produced primarily in france and california and on a lesser scale in australia italy new zealand south africa switzerland croatia slovenia and other parts of the united states merlot from the state of washington has been gaining recognition and a small quantity of high quality wine from this grape is now being produced on the eastern end of long island new york most wines from bordeaux contain at least some merlot and in the regions of pomerol and saint emilion it is not unusual for merlot to comprise the majority of the blend one of the most famous and rare wines in the world ch teau p trus is almost all merlot white merlot is made the same way as its more famous cousin white zinfandel the grapes are crushed and after very brief or even no skin contact the resulting pink must ferments some producers of white merlot include sutter home forest glen and beringer it normally has a hint of raspberry flavor white merlot was reputedly first marketed in the late one nine nine zero s merlot in the media according to anecdotal reports in the us media merlot received

m merry meet the traditional greeting used in pagan circles martin scorsese at cannes in two zero zero two martin scorsese born november one seven one nine four two in queens new york usa is an american film director a highly acclaimed film director scorsese s body of work addresses such themes as italian american identity catholic concepts of guilt and redemption machismo and the violence endemic in american society although he has received much critical acclaim and is one of the most recognizable names in the film industry he has never won an academy award despite numerous nominations scorsese is widely considered one of the most significant and influential of post war american film makers martin scorsese came from a working class italian american family his father luciano charles scorsese one nine one two one nine nine three and mother catherine scorsese one nine one two one nine nine seven both worked in new york s garment district a sickly child he spent much of his time recovering from asthma at home it was at this stage in his life that he developed his passion for cinema his initial desire to become a catholic priest was forsaken for cinema the catholic seminary traded for new york university where he received his m a in film in one nine six six career one nine six zero s and one nine seven zero s scorsese attended new york university s film school b a english one nine six four m a film one nine six six making short films his most famous short is the blackly comic the big shave which featured an unnamed man who shaves himself until he is profusely bleeding ultimately slitting his own throat with his razor many critics have claimed the film is an indictment of america s involvement in vietnam whatever its thematic concerns one can argue its visceral quality prefigured the director s entire oeuvre he made his first feature length film the black and white who s that knocking at my door with fellow student actor harvey keitel and editor thelma schoonmaker both of whom were to become long term collaborators this film was a clear precursor perhaps even a dry run for his later mean streets even in embryonic form the scorsese style was already evident a feel for new york italian american street life rapid editing and an eclectic rock soundtrack from there he became a friend and acquaintance of the so called movie brats of the one nine seven zero s francis ford coppola brian de palma george lucas and steven spielberg it was de palma who introduced actor robert de niro to scorsese and the two figures became close friends working together on many projects scorsese during this period also worked as one of the editors of the movie woodstock in one nine seven two scorsese made his directing debut with a depression set gangster film boxcar bertha for famed b movie producer roger corman who had also helped directors such as francis ford coppola james cameron and john sayles launch their careers widely considered a minor work boxcar bertha however taught scorsese how to make films cheaply and quickly preparing him for his first film with de niro mean streets championed by influential movie critic pauline kael mean streets was a breakthrough for scorsese de niro and keitel by now the signature scorsese style was present and correct macho posturing bloody violence catholic guilt and redemption gritty new york locale rapid fire editing and the obligatory rock soundtrack although extraordinarily fresh innovative and exciting it s wired atmosphere edgy documentary style and gritty street level direction perhaps owes a debt to directors john cassavetes and early jean luc godard indeed the film was completed with much encouragement from cassavetes who felt boxcar bertha was undeserving of the young director s prodigious talent actress ellen burstyn chose scorsese to direct her in the one nine seven four movie alice doesn t live here anymore for which she won an oscar for best actress although well regarded the film remains an anomaly in the director s early career focussing as it does on a central female character returning to little italy in new york city to explore his ethnic roots scorsese next came up with italianamerican a rich documentary featuring his parents charles and catherine scorsese both of whom went on to make cameo appearances in several of his movies for many years his mother worked as the official caterer for all of scorsese s films and his father helped in the wardrobe department black and white publicity still from taxi driver one nine seven six martin scorsese s cameo with robert de niro two years later in one nine seven six scorsese sent shockwaves through the cinema world when he directed the iconic taxi driver an unrelentingly grim and violent portrayal of one mans slow descent in to psychosis in a hellishly conceived manhattan scorsese s direction by now was highly accomplished using jump cuts expressionist lighting point of view shots and slow motion to reflect the protagonist s heightened psychological awareness however taxi driver s immense power was no doubt in part down to robert de niro s intense lead performance notable support was also given by jodie foster and harvey keitel taxi driver also marked the start of a series of collaborations with writer paul schrader the film bares strong thematic links to and makes several allusions to the work of french director robert bresson most explicitly pickpocket in essence the diary of a loner obsessive who finds redemption writer director schrader often returns to bresson s work in films such as american gigolo light sleeper and scorsese s later bringing out the dead five years after taxi driver was released in one nine eight one john hinckley jr made an assassination attempt on the american president ronald reagan he subsequently blamed his act on his obsession with jodie foster s character iris in scorsese s movie in taxi driver de niro s character travis bickle makes an assassination attempt on a senator taxi driver won the palme d or at the cannes film festival and also received four oscar nominations including best picture although all were unsuccessful in this cameo scorsese lounges in front of the building where cybill shepherd s character works according to shepherd scorsese requested a cybill shepherd type for the role she played in taxi driver the critical success of taxi driver encouraged scorsese to move ahead with his first big budget project the highly styilized musical new york new york this heart felt tribute to scorsese s home town and the classic hollywood musical was a box office and critical failure new york new york was the director s third collaboration with robert de niro co starring with liza minelli an obvious tribute and allusion to her father legendary musical director vincente minelli although possessing scorsese s usual visual panache and stylistic bravura many critics felt its enclosed studio bound atmosphere left it leaden in comparison to his earlier work often overlooked it remains one of the director s early key studies in to male paranoia and insecurity and hence is in direct thematic lineage with mean streets taxi driver and the later raging bull the disappointing reception new york new york received drove scorsese into depression by this stage the director had also developed a serious cocaine addiction however he did find the creative drive to make what is arguably the finest film about rock and roll the last waltz one nine seven eight a beautifully photographed documentary of the final concert by the band another scorsese directed documentary entitled american boy also appeared in one nine seven eight focussing on steve prince the cocky gun salesman in taxi driver a period of wild partying followed damaging the director s already fragile health one nine eight zero s by many accounts scorsese s included robert deniro practically saved his life when he persuaded him to kick his cocaine addiction to make what many consider his greatest film raging bull one nine eight zero convinced that he would never make another movie he poured his energies into making this violent biopic of middleweight boxing champion jake la motta nicknamed the bronx bull the film is widely viewed as a masterpiece and was voted the greatest film of the one nine eight zero s by britain s prestigious sight and sound magazine it received eight oscar nominations including best picture best actor for robert de niro and scorsese s first for best director de niro won as did thelma schoonmaker for the editing but scorsese lost to first time director robert redford raging bull filmed in high contrast black and white is perhaps where the director s style reached its zenith taxi driver and new york new york had used elements of expressionism to replicate psychological point of view but here the style was taken to new extremes extensive slow motion complex tracking shots extravagant distortion of perspective the size of boxing rings would change from fight to fight thematically too the concerns carried on from mean streets and taxi driver insecure males violence guilt redemption although the screenplay to raging bull was credited to paul schrader and mardik martin who earlier co wrote mean streets the finished script differed extensively from schrader s original draft it was re written several times by various writers including jay cocks who went on to co script the age of innocence and gangs of new york it is widely believed that the final draft was written by scorsese and robert de niro scorsese s next project was his fifth collaboration with robert de niro king of comedy one nine eight three an absurdist satire on the world of media and celebrity it was an obvious departure from the more emotionally committed films he had become associated with visually too it was far less kinetic then the style the director had developed up until this point often using a static camera the expressionism of his recent work gave way to moments of almost total surrealism however it was still an obvious scorsese work apart from the new york locale it bared many similarities to taxi driver not least its focus on an obsessed troubled loner who ironically achives iconic status through a criminal act murder and kidnapping respectively king of comedy bombed at the box office but has become increasingly well regarded by critics in the years since its release it is arguable that its themes of vacuous showbiz and celebrity obsession are more pertinent today then when the film was originally released in one nine eight three scorsese began work on a long cherished personal project the last temptation of christ based on the one nine five one book written by nikos kazantzakis which was introduced to the director by actress barbara hershey when they were both attending new york university in the late one nine six zero s the movie was slated to shoot under the paramount studios banner but shortly before principal photography was to commence paramount pulled the plug on the project citing pressure from religious groups in this aborted one nine eight three version aidan quinn was cast as jesus and sting was cast as pontius pilate in the one nine eight eight version these roles were played by willem dafoe and david bowie after the collapse of this project scorsese again saw his career at a critical point as he described in the recent documentary filming for your life making after hours two zero zero four he saw that in the increasingly commercial world of one nine eight zero s hollywood the highly stylized and personal one nine seven zero s films he and others had built their careers on would not continue to enjoy the same status and decided on an almost totally new approach to his work with after hours one nine eight five he made an aesthetic shift back to a pared down almost underground filmmaking style his way of staying viable filmed on an extremely low budget on location and at night in the soho neighborhood of manhattan the film is a black comedy about one increasingly misfortunate night for a mild new york word processor griffin dunne and featured cameos by such disparate actors as terri garr and cheech and chong a bit of a stylistic anomaly for scorsese after hours fits in well with popular low budget cult films of the one nine eight zero s by lesser known directors e g something wild or repo man along with the iconic one nine eight seven michael jackson music video bad in one nine eight six scorsese made the color of money a sequel to the much admired paul newman film the hustler one nine six zero the original was directed by robert rossen whose one nine four zero s boxing film body and soul was a major influence on raging bull although typically visually assured the colour of money was the directors first foray in to mainstream commercial film making it won actor paul newman a belated oscar and gave scorsese the clout to finally secure backing for a project that had been a long time goal for him the last temptation of christ scorsese filmed the last temptation of christ on a low budget in one nine eight seven knowing that the film would be controversial and would not take in record box office revenues however he did not anticipate the furore and controversy his movie would spark when it was released a year later nationwide protests against the film made it a textbook case for the modern method of religious outrage and influence the movie did have a number of staunch supporters particularly among film critics including scorsese s friend roger ebert scorsese also received his second nomination for best director although the award would go to barry levinson the backing of the movie by important political figures kept scorsese from becoming an outcast in hollywood and it gave him the impetus to film goodfellas one nine nine zero to present with goodfellas scorsese returned to his native new york and reunited with robert de niro and joe pesci whom he had previously directed in raging bull this motion picture of life as a gangster has been called the greatest mob movie since the godfather and it secured scorsese a place among the greatest motion picture directors of all time he earned his third and some would argue most deserving best director nomination but again lost to a first time director kevin costner scorsese gives part of the credit for his inspiration for his two well known gangster films to musketeers of pig alley one of the first ever gangster films made by the biograph company in one nine one two scorsese went on to direct a remake of the one nine six two thriller cape fear which proved to hollywood that he could make a box office hit however scorsese s projects have continued to cast him as a figure who can make critically acclaimed pictures the age of innocence kundun that only turn in modest box office revenues he continued to be intimately involved in filmmaking through the one nine nine zero s making cameo appearances in movies like quiz show as an unscrupulous television sponsor and search and destroy and working to help up and coming filmmakers mad dog and glory clockers he re visited the world of taxi driver in one nine nine nine with bringing out the dead while critics said that his one nine nine five movie casino looked and felt like a re hash of goodfellas scorsese also voiced one of the characters in shark tale as will smith s visibly annoyed boss a blowfish in one nine nine zero martin scorsese acted in a cameo role as vincent van gogh in the film dreams by legendary japanese director akira kurosawa in one nine nine nine he produced a documentary on italian filmakers entitled il mio viaggio in italia aka my voyage to italy the documentary was produced by giuliana del punta and bruno restuccia editing and printing has been made in cinecitta studios rome color timer was paolo verrucci scorsese s two zero zero two production of gangs of new york was seen as his biggest and most risk taking venture to date originally filmed for a release in the winter of two zero zero one to qualify for academy award nominations scorsese delayed the final production of the film until after the beginning of two zero zero two the studio consequently delayed the film for nearly a year until its release in the oscar season of late two zero zero two with a production budget said to be in excess of one zero zero million this was scorsese s most expensive work critical reaction to the film was moderately positive movie critics familiar with scorsese s work felt it was flawed and while the movie wasn t a smashing box office blockbuster it wasn t a dismal failure in theatrical revenue in february of two zero zero three gangs of new york received ten academy award nominations including best picture best director and best actor for daniel day lewis this being his fourth best director nomination many thought it was finally his year to win but the award went instead to roman polanski scorsese s film the aviator is a biopic of director producer legendary eccentric multi millionaire and aviation pioneer howard hughes it was released in december two zero zero four and met mostly with critical acclaim the film was nominated for six golden globe awards including best picture drama best director best screenplay and best

stone s white minidress in casino one nine nine five as the movie progresses these ladies usually prove to be anything but angelic often uses long tracking shots use of montage sequences involving aggressive camera movement and rapid editing set to popular music note his name is pronounced scor seh see themes the main themes of scorsese s work are intimately wrapped up in his roman catholic upbringing and his early attraction to the priesthood scorsese has once remarked that when he was growing up the most powerful people in his neighborhood were the gangsters and the priests he claims that as a filmmaker he is in some ways a combination of the two redemption and sin are the primary themes of scorsese s films his heroes tend to be fallen souls seeking redemption in a world of corruption they often achieve this redemption only through a passion a crucifixion of sorts in which a blood penance is extracted for their former sins charlie s final scene in mean streets travis bickle s psychotic rampage in taxi driver and jake lamotta s pounding his fists into the walls of his prison cell in raging bull would all seem to be expressions of this obsession with sin and redemption scorsese s films have oddly enough become more bleak in this regard as his career goes on goodfellas casino and the aviator all end with their protagonists trapped in a metaphorical purgatory from which it is uncertain they will be redeemed solitude and obsession also permeate scorsese s films his characters tend to be loners or misunderstood outcasts who are driven by emotional forces they cannot fully control over the course of his films these forces tend to gather strength until they erupt into a frenzy of emotional or physical violence it has been said that this is one of the factors which attracts actors to his films because it gives them the opportunity to play extremely emotionally dynamic characters the corruption of the material world and the fall from paradise are also persistent themes in scorsese s films particularly in his gangster films his characters are often torn between the temptations of the material world and the self betrayal of their own spirits that the material world demands of them this conflict often erupts into a cataclysmic fall from grace that sometimes leads to a quiet redemption this theme is most explicit in raging bull which ends with a new testament verse spoken by a blind man who has been given sight by jesus however this quote can be read as part of the film s dedication to haig p manoogian his nyu film school mentor oscar less director scorsese has been nominated five times for an oscar for best director but has never won this places him in the company of such directors as alfred hitchcock five nominations robert

her epilepsy charlie who has a strict catholic upbringing is probably too forgiving in general to get far in the mafia aside from his student film project who s that knocking at my door and boxcar bertha a directing project given him by early independent maverick roger corman this was scorsese s first feature film of his own design director john cassavetes told him after he completed boxcar bertha to make films he wanted to make about things he knew mean streets was based on actual events scorsese saw almost regularly while growing up in little italy the movie features a memorable six

critics award for best supporting actor for his role as john johnny boy civello the film has been deemed culturally significant by the library of congress and selected for preservation in the united

milius advised martin scorsese to do a more personal project next that encouragement led scorsese to finish this script and get it produced marks the first film collaboration between director martin scorsese and star robert de niro the voiceover narration in the opening of the movie you don t make up for your sins in church you do it on the street everything else is bullshit and you know it is actually not said by harvey keitel the character we are intended to believe is thinking these thoughts but director martin scorsese scorsese felt that using a separate voice to make the distinction between keitel s thoughts and actions was necessary and it has never been done in a movie before or since when raising money for the film martin scorsese was offered a healthy sum by his mentor roger corman on the condition that he shoot the movie with an all black cast scorsese had to turn corman down based on a script which martin scorsese co wrote with mardik martin in the one nine six zero s entitled season of the witch the innovative use of the hand held camera was largely down to the fact that the film s meager budget didn t stretch to laying down lots of tracks for all the tracking

grave muscle weakness is a neuromuscular disease leading to fluctuating weakness and fatiguability it is one of the best known autoimmune disorders and the antigens and disease mechanisms have been well identified weakness is caused by circulating antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors or the musk protein at the post synaptic neuromuscular junction inhibiting the stimulative effect of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine myasthenia is treated with immunosuppression and cholinesterase inhibitors signs and symptoms the hallmark of myasthenia gravis is muscle weakness that increases during periods of activity and improves after periods of rest certain muscles such as those that control eye and eyelid movement facial expression chewing talking and swallowing are often but not always involved in the disorder the muscles that control breathing and neck and limb movements can also be affected although myasthenia gravis may affect any voluntary muscle muscles that control eye and eyelid movement facial expression and swallowing are most frequently affected the onset of the disorder may be sudden or rapid symptoms often are not immediately recognized as myasthenia gravis a proportion only receives a diagnosis after more than a year in most cases the first noticeable symptom is weakness of the eye muscles in others difficulty in swallowing and slurred speech may be the first signs the degree of muscle weakness involved in myasthenia gravis varies greatly among patients ranging from a localized form limited to eye muscles ocular myasthenia to a severe or generalized form in which many muscles sometimes including those that control breathing are affected symptoms which vary in type and severity may include asymmetrical ptosis a drooping of one or both eyelids diplopia blurred or double vision due to weakness of the muscles that control eye movements unstable or waddling gait weakness in arms hands fingers legs and neck a change in facial expression dysphagia difficulty in swallowing and shortness of breath and dysarthria impaired speech often nasal due to weakness of the pharyngeal muscles a myasthenic crisis may give rise to a generalized paralysis including those of the respiratory muscles and assisted ventilation may be required to sustain life in patients whose respiratory muscles are already weak crises may be triggered by infection fever an adverse reaction to medication or emotional stress bedlack edrophonium test is infrequently performed to identify mg its application is limited to the situation when other investigations do not yield a conclusive diagnosis this test requires the intravenous administration of edrophonium chloride tensilon a drug that blocks the breakdown of acetylcholine by cholinesterase and temporarily increases the levels of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction in people with myasthenia gravis involving the eye muscles edrophonium chloride will briefly relieve weakness other methods to confirm the diagnosis include a version of nerve conduction study which tests for specific muscle fatigue by repetitive nerve stimulation this test records weakening muscle responses when the nerves are repetitively stimulated and helps to differentiate nerve disorders from muscle disorders repetitive stimulation of a nerve during a nerve conduction study may demonstrate decrements of the muscle action potential due to impaired nerve to muscle transmission imaging a chest x ray is frequently performed it may point towards alternative diagnoses e g lambert eaton due to a lung tumor and comborbidity it may also identify widening of the mediastinum suggestive of thymoma but computed tomography ct or magnetic resonance imaging mri are more senstive ways to identify thymomas and these are generally done for this reason pulmonary function test spirometry lung function testing may be performed to assess respiratory function if there are concerns about a patient s ability to breathe adequately severe myasthenia myasthenic crisis may cause respiratory failure due to exhaustion of the respiratory muscles pathophysiology myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease it features antibodies directed against the body s own proteins while in various similar diseases the disease has been linked to a cross reaction with an infective agent there is no known causative pathogen that could account for myasthenia there is a slight genetic predisposition particular hla types seem to predispose for mg b eight and dr three with dr one more specific for ocular myasthenia up to two five have a concurrent thymoma a tumor either benign or malignant of the thymus and other abnormalities are frequently found there are various theories that explain why thymoma may predispose to mg the disease process generally remains stationary after thymectomy removal of the thymus for tumor in mg the autoantibodies are directed against the acetylcholine receptor nicotinic type the receptor in the motor end plate for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine that stimulates muscular contraction some forms of the antibody impair the ability of acetylcholine to bind to receptors others lead to the destruction of receptors either by complement fixation or by inducing the muscle cell to eliminate the receptors through endocytosis in normal muscle contraction cumulative activation of the ach receptor leads to influx of sodium and calcium only when the levels of these electrolytes inside the muscle cell is high enough will it contract decreased numbers of functioning receptors therefore impairs muscular contraction epidemiology myasthenia gravis occurs in all ethnic groups and both genders it most commonly affects young adult women under four zero and older people of both sexes over six zero but it can occur at any age the prevalence in the united states is estimated at one four cases per one zero zero zero zero zero or roughly three six zero zero zero cases in the usa in neonatal myasthenia the fetus may acquire immune proteins antibodies from a mother affected with myasthenia gravis generally cases of neonatal myasthenia gravis are transient temporary and the child s symptoms usually disappear within few weeks after birth other children develop myasthenia gravis indistinguishable from adults myasthenia gravis is not directly inherited nor is it contagious occasionally the disease may occur in more than one member of the same family rarely children may show signs of congenital myasthenia or congenital myasthenic syndrome these are not autoimmune disorders but are caused by defective genes that control proteins in the acetylcholine receptor or in acetylcholinesterase treatment myasthenia gravis can usually be controlled with medication medication is used for two different endpoints direct improvement of the weakness reduction of the autoimmune process muscle function is improved by cholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine and pyridostigmine these slow the natural enzyme cholinesterase that degrades acetylcholine in the motor end plate the neurotransmitter is therefore around longer to stimulate its receptor immunosuppressive drugs such as prednisone cyclosporin and azathioprine may be used if the myasthenia is serious myasthenic crisis plasmapheresis is used to remove the putative antibody from the circulation similarly intravenous immunoglobulins ivig is used to bind the circulating antibodies thymectomy the surgical removal of the thymus gland which is abnormal in myasthenia gravis patients improves symptoms in more than five zero percent of patients even in those without thymoma some patients are cured by thymectomy suggesting that the thymus plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of myasthenia prognosis with treatment most patients have a near normal quality of life and no significant problems some cases of myasthenia gravis may go into remission temporarily and muscle weakness may disappear completely so that medication can be discontinued stable long lasting complete remissions are the goal of thymectomy references scherer k bedlack rs simel dl does this patient

business culture photo of microsoft s redwest campus microsoft has often been described as having a developer centric business culture a great deal of time and money is spent each year on recruiting young university trained software developers who meet very exacting criteria and on keeping them in the company for example while many software companies often place an entry level software developer in a cubicle desk within a large office space filled with other cubicles microsoft assigns a private or semiprivate closed office to every developer or pair of developers in addition key decision makers at every level are either developers or former developers in a sense the software developers at microsoft are considered the stars of the company in the same way that the sales staff at ibm are considered the stars of their company this culture is reflected in their hiring process the microsoft interview is notorious for off the wall questions such as why is a manhole cover round and is a process often mimicked in other organizations note that although they were once ubiquitous recently fewer interviewers have been using these types of questions within microsoft the expression eating our own dog food is used to describe the policy of using the latest microsoft products inside the company in an effort to test them in real world situations only prerelease and beta versions of

comfortable with ambiguity they may not for example know with any degree of certainty when a product will ship what it will be called or what features will be included the business culture expects agile thinkers to rapidly adjust to dramatic changes microsoft also fosters a general attitude of long term strategic wariness in its managers who are expected to be ready for any challenge from the competition or the market in this frame of mind being the largest software company in the world is not seen as a form of safety or a guarantee of future success for instance future competitors could rise from other industries or computer hardware companies could try to become less dependent on microsoft or consumers could decide not to upgrade their software as often microsoft requires its managers to maintain vigilance and sustain a dynamic expansion in new markets user culture technical reference for developers and articles for various microsoft magazines such as microsoft systems

instability microsoft has been the focus of much controversy in the computer industry especially since the one nine eight zero s most critically for its business tactics which some perceive as unfair and anticompetitive often these practices are described with the term embrace extend and extinguish in which microsoft initially embraces and extends a competing standard or product only to later extinguish it through such actions as writing their own incompatible version of the software or standard these and other tactics have led to microsoft being convicted by u s courts of being an abusive monopoly on at least one occasion as well as lawsuits by various companies and governments with varying degrees of success microsoft has also been called a velvet sweatshop in reference to allegations of the company working its employees to the point where it might be bad for their health the first instance of the term in reference to microsoft originated from a seattle times article in one nine eight nine and later became used to describe the company by some of microsoft s own employees some also accuse microsoft of allowing the user interface of its products to become inconsistent and overly complicated requiring interactive wizards to function as an extra layer between the user and the interface the security of microsoft products such as internet explorer is also questioned by some as being overly vulnerable to computer viruses and malicious attacks in addition proponents of open source are engaged with microsoft in a debate over the total cost of ownership tco of its products as some perceive microsoft software as more expensive to purchase use and maintain than competitors software free software proponents and other critics also point to the company s trustworthy computing initiative calling it treacherous computing a security proposal which some speculate will allow software developers to enforce any sort of client side restriction they wish over their software as well as microsoft s use of digital rights management technology designed to provide content and software providers the ability to put restrictions on how their products are used on their

financial educational and transportation center located on the river moskva the urban area constitutes about one one zero of the russian population thus making it the most populous city in europe the

and of muscovite russia the pre imperial russia it is the site of the famous kremlin which serves as the center of the national government moscow is also well known as the site of the saint basil s cathedral with its elegant onion domes the patriarch of moscow whose residence is the danilov monastery serves as the head of the russian orthodox church history saint basil s cathedral and spasskaya

finnic language in one one five six prince yuriy dolgorukiy built a wooden wall and a moat around the city after the sacking of one two three seven one two three eight when the mongols burned the city to the ground and killed its inhabitants moscow recovered and became the capital of an independent principality its favorable position on the headwaters of the volga river contributed to steady expansion moscow was also stable and prosperous for many years and attracted a large numbers of refugees from across russia under ivan i the city replaced tver as capital of vladimir suzdal and became the sole collector of taxes for the mongol rulers by paying high tribute ivan won an important concession from the khan unlike other principalities moscow was not divided among his sons but was passed intact to his eldest in one three eight zero prince dmitry donskoy of moscow led a united russian army to an important victory over the mongols in the battle of kulikovo after that moscow took the leading role in liberating russia from mongol domination in one four eight zero ivan iii had finally broken the russians free from tatar control bringing moscow to the zenith of power the russian capital which had wondered from kiev to vladimir came rest in this city by the end of his reign and moscow became the capital of an empire that would eventually encompass all of russia and siberia and parts of many other lands kremlin embankment and moscow skyline with cathedral of christ the saviour on the left and kremlin on the right moscow ceased to be russia s capital when in one seven zero

evacuated together with much of the government and from october two zero the city was declared to be under siege its remaining inhabitants built and manned antitank defenses while the city was bombarded from the air it is of some note that stalin refused to leave the city and the general staff and the council of ministers remained in the city on may one one nine four four a medal for the defence of moscow and in one nine four seven another medal in memory of the eight zero zero th anniversary of moscow were instituted on may eight one nine six five in commemoration of the two zero th anniversary of the victory in world war ii moscow was awarded a title of the hero city in one nine eight zero it hosted the summer olympic games in one nine nine one moscow was the scene of a coup attempt by the government members opposed to the reforms of mikhail gorbachev when the ussr was dissolved in the same year moscow continued to be the capital of the russian federation since then the emergence of a market economy in moscow has produced an explosion of western style retailing services architecture and lifestyles administrative divisions administrative divisions of moscow main article administrative divisions of moscow moscow is divided into ten administrative districts of which only nine are located geographically in the city and one corresponds to a satellite city of zelenograd although being categorized as a city and separated geographically from the rest of moscow administratively zelenograd is part of the russian capital administrative districts administered by prefecturas headed by prefect each administrative district consists of several municipal districts unofficially called raions each municipal district as well as administrative district has its own coat of arms flag and administered by uprava headed by elected person along with municipal districts there are several teoses in moscow territorial unities with special status or shortly territories these usually include areas with small or none permanent population such as all russia exhibition centre botanical garden large parks and industrial zones recent years some teoses were merged with different raions there are no ethnic specific raions in moscow also there are no definitely rich or poor raions although living closer to city centre metro station or green zones is generally considered more prestigious most raions have their own cable television computer network and official newspaper culture moscow and st petersburg have for centuries been the sites of much of the country s internationally known history and culture and the residences of most of its famous personalities architecture the city was once known as sorok sorokov forty times forty in reference to the many orthodox onion domes making up the city s skyline the look of the city was changed drastically during soviet times mostly due to stalin who oversaw a large scale effort to modernize the city by on the one hand introducing very broad avenues and roadways some of them over ten lanes wide and on the other destroying a great number of historically significant architectural works such as the sukharev tower and numerous mansions and stores lining the major streets and various works of religious architecture such as the christ the saviour cathedral the latter was demolished to make way for a huge skyscraper that was never built and reconstructed in the mid to late nine zero s ostankino tower the tallest free standing structure in eurasia stalin did build seven other skyscrapers however allegedly inspired by the municipal building in new york they form a series of huge cathedral like structures with intricate exteriors and are given various labels the seven sisters stalinist gothic wedding cake architecture and so on all seven can be seen from most elevations in the city they are among the tallest constructions in central moscow apart from the ostankino tower which when it was built in one nine six seven was the tallest free standing land structure in the world before the title was taken by the cn tower the soviet policy of providing mandatory housing for every citizen or their family and the rapid growth of the huge moscow population in soviet times also led to the construction of large monotonous housing blocks which can often be differentiated in age sturdiness of construction or style according to the neighbourhood and the materials used most of these date from the post stalin era and the styles are often named after the leader then in power brezhnev krushchev etc and they are usually ill maintained the stalinist era constructions usually in the central city are massive and usually ornamented with socialist realism motifs that imitate classical themes however small churches almost always orthodox that hint on the city s past still dot various parts of the city the old arbat a popular tourist street that was once the heart of a bohemian area preserves most of its one nine th century or older buildings many buildings found off the main streets of the inner city behind the stalinist facades of tverskaya street for example are also examples of the bourgeois decadence in tsarist times ostankino kuskovo and other large estates just outside moscow belonging to nobles from the tsarist era and some both inside and outside the city are open to muscovites and tourists attempts are being made to restore many of the city s best kept examples of pre soviet architecture and these are easily spotted by their bright new colours and spotless facades there are a few examples of notable early soviet avant garde work too such as the house of the architect konstantin melnikov in the arbat area later examples of interesting soviet architecture are usually marked by their impressive size and the semi modernist styles employed such as the novy arbat project designed by mikhail posokhin like in london but on a broader scale plaques on the house exteriors will inform passers by that a well known personality once lived there frequently the plaques are dedicated to soviet celebrities not well known to the outside world there are also many

collections that can be compared to those of the best museums in the west frequent art exhibitions thrive on both the new and the classic as they once did in pre revolutionary times and from their diversity in every branch of the arts painting photography sculpture and so on it would appear that the muscovite art world is steeped in many traditions russian western oriental both old and new two of the most notable art museums in moscow are the tretyakov gallery founded by paul tretyakov a wealthy and generous patron of the arts who accumulated a very large private collection before donating it to the city and the pushkin museum of fine arts which was founded among others by marina tsvetaeva s father currently there are two tretyakovs the old tretyakov the original gallery in the tretyakovskaya area on the south bank of the moskva houses the works of the classic russian tradition with famous pre revolutionary painters such as ilya repin going all the way back to early russian icon painting with exhibits of rare originals by andrei rublev the new tretyakov created in soviet times mostly houses the work of soviet and a few contemporary artists but there is some overlap between the two for early two zero th century art the latter includes a small reconstruction of vladimir tatlin s famous monument to the third international and a mixture of other avant garde works by artists like kazimir malevich or wassily kandinsky and soviet propaganda the pushkin museum is like the british museum in that its halls are a cross section of world civilizations with many plaster casts of ancient sculptures but it also hosts famous paintings from every major western era of art the work of monet cezanne picasso and so on can all be sampled there moscow is also the heart of russian performing arts including ballet theatres and ballet studios are very common in moscow the most famous of these are the bolshoi big and malyy small theatres a centerpiece of moscow the bolshoi is usually closed during the summer but in two zero zero five it closed semi permanently for reconstruction work ticket prices were as low as one in the soviet era but have increased dramatically since the repertories in a typical moscow season are exhaustive and modern interpretations of classic works whether operatic or theatrical are quite common soviet films are integral to film history and the mosfilm studio was at the heart of many classics both artistic and more mainstream productions however despite the continued presence and reputation of internationally renowned russian filmmakers the once prolific native studios are much quieter and there are fewer independent cinema theatres in moscow than there were around the end of the soviet union having given way to multiplexes and recent hollywood productions the overall maintenance and condition of theatres has improved though ticket prices are much higher and increase every year transport heavy traffic and active construction two zero zero three moscow has five airports sheremetyevo international airport domodedovo international airport bykovo airport ostafievo international airport and vnukovo international airport the city is also the main rail hub for russia with daily trains to diverse destinations such as vladivostok nine zero zero zero km and brussels two zero zero zero km local transport includes the moscow metro an excellent metro subway system famous for its art murals mosaics and ornate chandeliers begun in one nine three five the system has one one lines and more than one seven one stations the system is the world s busiest with nine million passengers every day and trains every nine zero seconds at peak times moscow monorail as metro stations outside the city centre are far apart in comparison to other cities up to four km an extensive bus network radiates from each station to the surrounding residential zones suburbs and several city areas also connected with electric train elektrichka network the buses are very frequent often more than one a minute every large street in the city is served by at least one bus route and none of the city s one three zero zero zero apartment blocks are more than a few minutes walk from a stop there are also tram and trolleybus networks underground electric railway elektrichka station in vnukovo airport there are over two five million cars in the city on a daily basis as of two zero zero four recent years have seen explosive growth in the number of cars which have caused traffic jams and the lack of parking space to become major problems the road system is structured with sequences of radial and ring roads the first and innermost bulvarnoye koltso boulevard ring built at the former location of the one six th century city wall around what used to be called bely gorod white town boulevard ring is technically not a ring it is not connected and has a horseshoe like shape the second ring sadovoye koltso garden ring follows the line of another one six th century wall the earth wall encircling historic earth town after the war of one eight one two the earth wall was demolished and replaced by streets and gardens during the reconstruction of the one nine three zero s the garden ring took its current shape the streets were widened and the gardens were gone the third transport ring was completed in two zero zero three and the fourth transport ring is being constructed to reduce traffic congestion the outer ring a large road called mkad forms the approximate boundary of the city mkad along with third and future fourth transport rings are the only freeways within city limits everyday life although less than a quarter of russians live in the countryside many muscovites like other urban dwellers are still attached to the country many live in country homes called dachas over the weekend and over holidays and retire to the country when they are old moscow contains many parks and gardens see sport huge shopping malls both urban and suburban with their multiplex theatres department stores grocery chains food courts and other common features are now very common in moscow and they are very popular with the city s adolescents most of whom like their western counterparts like to project themselves as trendy education moscow state university there are in moscow including the renowned moscow state university housed in the two four zero m high tower on vorobyovy gory sparrow hills the university has over three zero zero zero zero undergraduates and seven zero zero zero postgraduate students bauman moscow state technical university offers a wide range of technical degrees moscow state institute of international relations is russia s best known school of international relations and diplomacy business and trade a major part of russia s profits and development is concentrated in moscow many multi national corporations have branches and offices in the city the plush offices and the lifestyles of the typical corporate employee in moscow are practically indistinguishable from any other western european city although the average salary for the russian is still lower here after the financial crisis in the late nine zero s various business sectors in moscow have shown exponential rates of growth however while the overall stability has improved in the recent years crime and corruption continue to remain a problem hindering business development a recent study showed that far from decreasing corruption in the putin era has been on the rise and large businesses can expect to pay an average of over a hundred thousand dollars a year in bribes to officials the mafia also runs extortion rackets in most parts of the city though there are no reliable data to understand how large their influence is according to a july two two two zero zero four article in forbes moscow became the city with the most billionaires it had three three billionaires passing new york city by two the nouveau riche also called the new russians often pejoratively have a reputation for flaunting their wealth the avenues for doing so and subtly have also increased in recent times a sense of fashion and self consciousness has instilled itself through the many haute couture and haute cuisine spots in moscow tourism average temperature red and precipitations blue in moscow moscow has always been a popular destination for more adventurous tourists the better known attractions include the unesco world heritage sites of the kremlin red square and the church of the ascension at kolomenskoye all dating from between the one four th and one seven th centuries other popular attractions include the zoo expanded in the one nine nine zero s moscow is also the western end of the nine three zero zero km trans siberian railway to vladivostok the city presents a unique look in midwinter when the streets are cloaked in powdery snow and the dusky twilight of the continental winter in winter the locals face the cold with the warm embrace of hospitality however as temperatures can often be below two five c one three f early summer or early autumn can offer a much more comfortable and lively visit russians like to have fun as much as anyone else and the very short summers mean that one can find people involved in social events or roving about or drinking outside at very late hours the abundant greenery of moscow gives the city a semi tropical feel that pleasantly surprises the visitor accustomed to stereotypes about the russian cold the long days will also afford one more time to cover the immense wealth of historical cultural or simply popular sites in moscow scenic vantage points include the sparrow hills on the moscow river to the south west of the city moscow presents many obstacles to the independent foreign tourist without local contacts while it is not hard to get a visa and enter the country it is quite common to resort to somewhat expensive semi legal procedures to register oneself the registration process is deliberately bureaucratic complicated and immensely time consuming if one is not staying at a hotel new medical and work permit requirements have also been introduced by the government which increases the stress and expenses involved for long term visitors who are already required to leave the country every six months and re register upon entry while excellent hotels are found all over moscow they are usually not for the budget traveller and not for long term visitors novodevichy convent is just one of many medieval monuments that dots the city everyone is also required to carry their passport for identification and so that the registration can be checked by local militia who also pose a problem they are found all over the city but especially in and around metro stations being underpaid they frequently attempt to supplement their income by stopping people arbitrarily checking their passports and demanding bribes to prevent arrest over trivial reasons also with the recent terrorist actions being associated with the darker skinned caucasian population official police racism against all dark skinned people is rife and the latter are likely to be stopped much more often sometimes as much as thrice a week violent crime especially but not only directed against foreigners is also a frequent occurrence in moscow however the average tourist making a brief visit on a package tour is not likely to encounter any of these problems the educated section of the populace are open minded and can be very helpful and expatriates who like making russian friends find their curiosity and enthusiasm reciprocated and usually have fond memories of their stay once they understand the system while customer service is still something new to many russian vendors burgeoning westernization means that high profile and tourist stores all over moscow may give you special attention if you are a foreigner moscow tourist attractions bolshoi

high temperatures in the warm months of july and august are three zero c eight five nine zero f in the winter temperatures may drop to one five c three f in january and february costs some prices are considerably higher for the foreign visitor than for locals a cost of living survey by mercer human resource consulting puts moscow in second place after tokyo making it the most expensive city in europe for natives small apartments bought or given by the state in the soviet era coupled with extremely low utility costs and easily avoidable income tax serve to lower the cost of living greatly a look at transport prices offers a good illustration a taxi from sheremetyevo international airport will cost the non russian speaking traveller upwards of six zero the russian speaking foreigner will be charged three zero four zero the native moscow dweller will negotiate the price to one five two zero or will avoid the taxi rank altogether and take a marshrutka shuttle shared taxi to the nearest metro station for about zero five dollar dining in recent times there has been a large and quickly growing range of restaurants with a range of prices to match the average cost per person for a meal in a middle to high class restaurant will be three zero to two zero zero especially if one orders vintage wines chain restaurants such as moo moo offer adequate quality canteen food with english menus for around five dollars per person although most moscovites do not eat in even cheap restaurants very often lately many new middle class restaurants have opened targeting families on weekends the korchma chain of ukrainian restaurants offers menus in over a dozen languages a number of fast food restaurants have outlets near many metro stations that includes the omnipresent mcdonald s as well as other chains notably rostiks which specializes in serving chicken and kroshka kartoshka serving traditional baked potato with numerous toppings danish style stardogs and many others many mcdonald s

europe on the south by africa and on the east by asia it covers an approximate area of two five million km nine six five zero zero zero mi it is also called the eurafrican mediterranean sea or the european mediterranean sea in oceanography to distinguish it from mediterranean seas elsewhere it was a superhighway of transport in ancient times allowing for trade and cultural exchange between emergent peoples of the region egyptians greeks romans and the middle east arab persian semitic cultures the history of the mediterranean is important in understanding the origin and development of western civilization name the term mediterranean derives from the latin mediterraneus inland medius middle terra land earth in greek mesogeios the mediterranean sea has been known by a number of alternative names throughout human history it was for example commonly called mare nostrum latin our sea by the romans in the bible it is referred to as the great sea or the western sea in modern hebrew it is called ha yam ha tichon the middle sea a literal adaptation of the german equivalent mittelmeer in turkish it is akdeniz the white sea in arabic it is al bahr al abiad al muttawasit the middle white sea currently the med is a common british english contraction for the mediterranean sea and its surrounding regions when employed in informal speech geography map of the mediterranean sea the mediterranean sea is connected to the atlantic ocean by the strait of gibraltar on the west and to the sea of marmara and black sea by the dardanelles and the bosporus respectively on the east the sea of marmara is often considered a part of the mediterranean sea whereas the black sea is generally not the man made suez canal in the south east connects the mediterranean sea with the red sea tides are very limited in the mediterranean as a result of the narrow connection with the ocean the mediterranean climate is generally one of wet winters and hot dry summers special crops of the region are olives grapes oranges tangerines and cork the region has a long history of civilization large islands in the mediterranean include cyprus crete euboea rhodes lesbos chios kefalonia and corfu in the eastern mediterranean sardinia corsica sicily and malta in the central mediterranean ibiza majorca and minorca the balearic islands in the western mediterranean bordering countries modern

turkey geology the geology of the mediterranean is complex involving the break up and then collision of the african and eurasian plates and the messinian salinity crisis in the late miocene when the mediterranean dried up the mediterranean sea has an average depth of one five zero zero m and the deepest recorded point is five two six seven meters about three two seven miles in the calypso deep in the ionian sea the coastline extends for four six zero zero zero km a shallow submarine ridge the strait of sicily between the island of sicily and the coast of tunisia divides the sea in two main subregions which in turn are divided into subdivisions the western mediterranean and the eastern mediterranean the western mediterranean covers an area of about zero eight five million km and the eastern mediterranean about one six five million km in the last few centuries mankind has done much to alter mediterranean geology structures have been built all along the coastlines exacerbating and rerouting erosional patterns many pollution producing boats travel the sea that unbalance the natural chemical ratios of the region beaches have been mismanaged and the overuse of the sea s natural and marine resources continues to be a problem this misuse speeds along and or confounds natural processes the actual geography has also been altered by the building of dams and canals the mediterranean was once thought to be the remnant of the tethys ocean it is now known to be a structurally younger ocean basin known as neotethys neotethys formed during the late triassic and early jurassic rifting of the african and eurasian plates ecology as a result of the drying of the sea during the messinian salinity crisis the marine biota of the mediterranean are derived primarily from the atlantic ocean the north atlantic is considerably colder and more nutrient rich than the mediterranean and the marine life of the mediterranean has had to adapt to its differing conditions in the five million years since the basin was reflooded the opening of the suez canal in one eight six nine created the first salt water passage between the mediterranean and red seas the red sea is higher than the eastern mediterranean so the canal serves as a salt water river that pours red sea water into the mediterranean the bitter lakes which are hypersaline natural lakes that form part of the canal blocked the migration of red sea species into the mediterranean for many decades but as the salinity of the lakes gradually equalized with that of the red sea the barrier to migration was removed and plants and animals from the red sea have begun to colonize the eastern mediterranean the red sea is generally saltier and more nutrient poor than the atlantic so the red sea species have advantages over atlantic species in the salty and nutrient poor eastern mediterranean the construction of the aswan high dam across the nile river in the one nine six zero s reduced the inflow of freshwater and nutrient rich silt from the nile into the eastern mediterranean which has made conditions there even more like the red sea this species exchange is known as the lessepsian migration

who is actually an actor many participants continued to give shocks despite pleas for mercy from the actor the milgram experiment obedience to authority study was a famous scientific experiment of social psychology the experiment was first described by stanley milgram a psychologist at yale university in an article titled behavioral study of obedience published in the journal of abnormal and social psychology in one nine six three and later discussed at book length in his one nine seven four obedience to authority an experimental view it was intended to measure the willingness of a participant to obey an authority who instructs the participant to do something that may conflict with the participant s personal conscience the experiments began in july one nine six one a year after the trial of adolf eichmann in jerusalem milgram devised the experiment to answer the question could it be that eichmann and his million accomplices in the holocaust were just following orders could we call them all accomplices milgram one nine seven four milgram summed up in the article the perils of obedience milgram one nine seven four writing the legal and philosophic aspects of obedience are of enormous import but they say very little about how most people behave in concrete situations i set up a simple experiment at yale university to test how much pain an ordinary citizen would inflict on another person simply because he was ordered to by an experimental scientist stark authority was pitted against the subjects participants strongest moral imperatives against hurting others and with the subjects participants ears ringing with the screams of the victims authority won more often than not the extreme willingness of adults to go to almost any lengths on the command of an authority constitutes the chief finding of the study and the fact most urgently demanding explanation method of the experiment for the experiment subjects were recruited by newspaper ads and direct mail to participate in a study at yale the experiments themselves took place in two rooms in the basement of linsly chittenden hall on the university s old campus the experiment was advertised as taking one hour for which those responding would be paid four five zero participants were men between the ages of two zero and five zero coming from all educational backgrounds ranging from an elementary school dropout to participants with doctoral degrees the participant and a confederate of the experimenter who would be an actor pretending to be another participant were told by the experimenter that they would be participating in an experiment to test the effects of punishment on learning behavior a slip of paper was given to the participant and another to the confederate the participant was led to believe that one of the slips said learner and the other said teacher and that the participants had been given the slips randomly in fact both slips said teacher but the actor claimed to have the slip that read learner thus guaranteeing that the participant was always the teacher at this point the teacher and learner were separated into different rooms where they could communicate but not see each other the confederate was sure to mention to the participant that he had a heart condition the teacher was given a four five volt electric shock from the electro shock generator as a sample of the shock that the learner would supposedly receive during the experiment the teacher was then given a list of word pairs which he was to teach the learner the teacher began by reading the list of word pairs to the learner the teacher would then read the first word of each pair and read four possible answers the learner would press a button to indicate his response if the answer was incorrect the learner would receive a shock with the voltage increasing by one five volts with each wrong answer if correct the teacher read the next word pair the subjects believed that for each wrong answer the learner was receiving actual shocks in reality there were no shocks after the confederate was separated from the subject the confederate set up a tape recorder integrated with the electro shock generator which played pre recorded sounds for each shock level after a number of voltage level increases the actor started to bang on the wall that separated him from the subject after several times banging on the wall and complaining about his heart condition the learner gave no further response to the questions and made no further complaints at this point many people indicated their desire to stop the experiment and check on the learner many test subjects paused at one three five volts and began to question the purpose of the experiment some continued after being assured that they would not be held responsible some subjects began to laugh nervously once they heard the screams of pain coming from the learner if at any time the subject indicated his desire to halt the experiment he was given a succession of verbal prods by the experimenter in this order please continue the experiment requires you to continue please go on it is essential that you continue you have no choice you must continue if the subject still wished to stop after all four successive verbal prods the experiment was halted otherwise it was halted after the subject had given the maximum four five zero volt shock three times in succession results milgram created a documentary film showing the experiment and its results titled obedience legitimate copies of which are hard to find today he then produced a series of five other films on social psychology with harry from some of which touched on his experiments they may all be obtained from penn state media services before the experiment was conducted milgram polled fellow psychologists as to what the results would be they unanimously believed that only a few sadists would be prepared to give the maximum voltage in milgram s first set of experiments six five percent two seven out of four zero of experimental participants administered the experiment s final four five zero volt shock though many were quite uncomfortable in doing so everyone paused at some point and questioned the experiment some even saying they would return the cheque for the money they were paid no participant steadfastly refused to give further shocks before the three zero zero volt level variants of the experiment were later performed by milgram himself and other psychologists around the world with similar results apart from confirming the original results the variations have tested variables in the experimental setup dr thomas blass of the university of maryland baltimore county who is also the author of a biography of milgram called the man who shocked the world performed a meta analysis on the results of repeated performances of the experiment he found that the percentage of participants who are prepared to inflict fatal voltages remains remarkably constant between six one and six six regardless of time or location a popular account of blass results was published in psychology today march april two zero zero two the full results were published in the journal of applied social psychology blass one nine nine nine there is a little known coda to the experiment reported by philip zimbardo none of the participants who refused to administer the final shocks insisted that the experiment itself be terminated nor left the room to check that the victim was well without asking for permission to leave according to milgram s notes and recollections when he was asked on this point by zimbardo reactions the experiment raised questions about the ethics of scientific experimentation itself because of the extreme emotional stress suffered by the participants even though it could be said that this stress was brought on by their own free actions most modern scientists would consider the experiment unethical today though it resulted in valuable insights into human psychology in milgram s defense eight four percent of former participants surveyed later said they were glad or very glad to have participated and one five percent chose neutral nine two of all former participants responding many later wrote expressing thanks milgram repeatedly received offers of assistance and requests to join his staff from former participants six years later during the height of the vietnam war one of the participants in the experiment sent correspondence to milgram explaining why they were glad to have been involved despite the apparent levels of stress while i was a subject participant in one nine six four though i believed that i was hurting someone i was totally unaware of why i was doing so few people ever realize when they are acting according to their own beliefs and when they are meekly submitting to authority to permit myself to be drafted with the understanding that i am submitting to authority s demand to do something very wrong would make me frightened of myself i am fully prepared to go to jail if i am not granted conscientious objector status indeed it is the only course i could take to be faithful to what i believe my only hope is that members of my board act equally according to their conscience however not everyone went through the life changing experience reported by some former participants participants were not fully debriefed by modern standards and exit interviews appeared to indicate that many seemed to never fully understand the nature of the experiment variations milgram describes one nine variations of the experiment that he conducted in obedience to authority an experimental view in general he found that when the immediacy of the victim was increased compliance decreased and when immediacy of the authority increased compliance increased experiments one four for instance in one variation where participants received instructions from the experimenter only by telephone experiment two compliance greatly decreased interestingly a number of participants deceived the experimenter by pretending to continue the experiment in the variation where immediacy of the learner was closest participants had to physically hold the learner s arm onto a shock plate which decreased compliance in this latter condition three zero percent still completed the experiment in experiment eight women were used as participants all of milgram s other experiments used only men obedience did not differ significantly though they indicated experiencing higher levels of stress in one version experiment one zero milgram rented a modest office in bridgeport connecticut purporting to be run by a commercial entity called research associates of bridgeport with no apparent connection to yale in order to eliminate the prestige of the university as a possible factor influencing participants behavior the results of this experiment did not greatly differ from those conducted at the yale campus milgram also combined the power of authority with that of conformity in these experiments the participant was joined by one or two additional teachers who were actually actors like the learner the behavior of the participants apparent peers strongly affected results when two additional teachers refused to comply experiment one seven only four participants of four zero continued the experiment in another version experiment one eight the participant performed a subsidiary task with another teacher who complied fully in this variation only three of four zero defied the experimenter in popular culture variations on the milgram experiment have pervaded the popular culture through film tv and music the tenth level was a one nine seven five tv dramatization of the experiment starring in the film were william shatner ossie davis and john travolta i comme icare english title i as in icarus a one nine seven nine movie by henri verneuil starring yves montand contains a key scene where milgram s experiment on obedience to authority is thoroughly explained and shown it may add up to some conspiracy theories regarding the assassination of john f kennedy since the plot of this film is largely an obvious subtext to the assassination of the kennedy brothers ghostbusters a blockbuster one nine eight four movie written by harold ramis and dan aykroyd contains a scene introducing bill murray s

extends from about two three to five three million years before the present as with other older geologic periods the rock beds that define the start and end are well identified but the exact dates of the start and end of the period are uncertain the miocene was named by sir charles lyell its name comes from the greek words meion less and ceno new and means less recent because it has one eight less than the pliocene of modern sea invertebrates the miocene follows the oligocene epoch and is followed by the pliocene epoch the miocene is the first epoch of the neogene period the miocene boundaries are not set at an easily identified worldwide event but rather at regional boundaries between the warmer oligocene and the cooler pliocene miocene subdivisions the miocene faunal stages from youngest to oldest are the subdivisions within the miocene are defined by the relative abundance of different species of calcareous nanofossils calcite platelets shed by brown single celled algae and foraminifera single celled protists with diagnostic shells miocene climate climates remained moderately warm although the slow global cooling that eventually led to the pleistocene glaciations continued although a long term cooling trend was well underway there is evidence for a warm period during the miocene when the global climate rivalled that of the oligocene the miocene warming began two one million years ago and continued until one four million years ago when global temperatures took a sharp drop by eight million years ago temperatures dropped sharply once again and the antarctic ice sheet was already approaching its present day size and thickness greenland may have begun to have large glaciers as early as seven to eight million years ago although the climate for the most part remained warm enough to support forests there well into the pliocene miocene paleogeography continents continued to drift toward their present positions of the modern geologic features only the land bridge between south america and north america was absent mountain building took place in western north america and europe both continental and marine miocene deposits are common worldwide with marine outcrops common near modern shorelines well studied continental exposures occur in the american great plains and in argentina miocene flora grasslands underwent a major expansion as forests fell victim to a generally cooler and drier climate overall grasses also diversified greatly into a number of species and also caused a major increase in the biodiversity of large herbivores including ruminants of which modern cattle and deer belong to miocene fauna both marine and continental fauna were fairly modern only in isolated south america and australia did widely divergent fauna exist mammals recognizable wolves horses beaver deer camels whales etc existed in the miocene birds recognizable crows ducks and owls appear in the miocene miocene oceans the oceans continue cooling and

berkeley miocene epoch page miocene for other senses see monarch disambiguation a monarch see sovereign is a type of ruler or head of state monarchs almost always inherit their titles and are rulers for life that is they have no term limit historically monarchs have been more or less absolute rulers modern monarchs are often figureheads with little power however there are others with substantial or absolute power monarchs usually represent a larger monarchical system which has established rules and customs regarding succession duties and powers a nation ruled by a monarch is called a monarchy the word monarch derives from greek monos archein meaning one ruler and referred to an absolute ruler in ancient greece with time the word has been succeeded in this meaning by others like autocrat or dictator and the word monarch in modern usage almost always refers to a traditional system of hereditary rulership but see the discussion on elective monarchies below possible definitions of the term which rulers are considered monarchs today is partially a matter of tradition so there are no hard and fast rules there are however a number of characteristics that are commonly though not universally distinguishing for monarchs most monarchs hold their office for life while most other rulers do not a monarch may chose to resign his position through abdication though this is a rare and dramatic practice exceptions to this include the french co prince of andorra who is not appointed for life he is the french president elected for a five year period by the french people but still generally considered a monarch because of the use of a traditionally monarchical title though a purist might regard andorra as a diarchy similarly the yang di pertuan agong king of malaysia is considered a monarch although only holding the office five years at a time on the other hand several life time dictators around the world have not been considered monarchs most monarchs are raised within a royal family where they are taught to expect and obey their future duties and they are formally or informally succeeded upon their death or abdication by members of their own family usually their eldest son or eldest child as a result most stable monarchies have a long legacy of rule by a single family or bloodline once again malaysia is an exception as is the vatican city the pope bears the title sovereign of the state of the vatican city also the practice is not totally uncommon in systems which are not considered monarchical such as family dictatorships most monarchs hold titles that are traditional among monarchs see below while this is a fairly arbitrary characteristic it might just be the best distinction between monarchs and non monarchs at the moment different types of monarchs monarchy is the form of government involving a monarch it can be either absolute or constitutional and constitutional monarchies may even restrict the powers of the monarch to the point where he or she is little more than a near powerless figurehead which is a common modern practice the word monarchy can also be used about a country which has such a system normally however such countries identify themselves more narrowly depending on the actual title used by the monarch e g as a kingdom grand duchy or principality elective monarchies were once common although only a very small portion of the population was eligible to vote as the impact of the feudal system diminished many monarchs were eventually allowed to introduce hereditary succession guaranteeing that the title and office will stay within the family today almost all monarchies are hereditary monarchies in which the monarchs come from one royal family with the office of sovereign being passed from one family member to another upon the death or abdication of the incumbent existing elective monarchies include malaysia saudi arabia and the holy see the former system of the election of the doge in venice is also widely known a sovereign is the monarch of a sovereign state although non sovereign states have often had monarchs historically not least within the holy roman empire all european monarchs since one nine one eight have been sovereigns outside europe there still exist several monarchs of subnational entities however most notably in malaysia and the united arab emirates a more obscure example is that of kings of the french wallis and futuna territory in a few cases a monarch is associated with a particular group or nation within a state such as te arikinui te atairangikaahu of the m ori the m ori queen and osei tutu ii of the ashanti european monarchical titles in europe a monarch may traditionally bear any of several titles each of these titles has a male and female version the female versions are used not only in the case that the monarch is female but also for wives of monarchs when there is need to distinguish between the two cases terms like queen regnant and queen consort are used the converse is not true however the husband of a queen regnant is not automatically a king e g the duke of edinburgh is not king philip of the united kingdom there is an urban legend that female rulers are a peculiarly modern phenomenon and that this has lead to more frequent use of the gender neutral word monarch in fact the historical record shows that there have been many female rulers throughout history in a wide variety of cultures the normal monarch title in europe i e the one used if the monarch has no higher title is prince counterpart princess it was a common title within the holy roman empire along with a number of higher titles listed below such titles were granted by the emperor while the titulation of rulers of sovereign states was generally left to the discretion of themselves most often choosing king counterpart queen such titulations could cause diplomatic problems and especially the elevation to emperor counterpart empress was seen as an offensive action during the one nine th and two zero th centuries most small monarchies in europe disappeared to form larger entities and so king has become the most common title today for male rulers and queen for female rulers since the pope is bishop of rome a celibate office forbidden to women there is no female equivalent legends of female popes see pope joan refer to them as pope some european languages have a feminine form of the word pope such as the french papesse to pape or german p pstin to papst used among other things for the high priestess tarot card note that some of these titles have several meanings and do not necessarily designate a monarch a prince can be a person of royal blood some languages uphold this distinction see f rst a duke can be a british peer in imperial russia a grand duke was a son or grand son of the tsar holders of titles in these alternative meanings did not enjoy the same status as actual monarchs of the same title within the holy roman empire there were even more titles that were occasionally used for monarchs although they were normally noble margrave count palatine landgrave an actual monarch with such low titles still outranked a noble duke today there are seven kingdoms one grand duchy and two principalities in europe excluding the peculiar case of andorra monarchical titles in use by non monarchs it is not uncommon that people who are not generally seen as monarchs nevertheless use monarchical titles there are four cases of this claiming an existing title challenging the current holder this has been very common historically for centuries the british monarch used among his other titles the title king of france despite the fact that he had no authority over french territory there have also been numerous antipopes retaining the title of an extinct monarchy this can be coupled with a claim that the monarchy was in fact never or should never have been extinct an example of the first case is the prince of seborga examples of the second case are several deposed monarchs or otherwise pretenders to thrones of abolished monarchies e g leka crown prince of albania who is styled by some as the king of albania retaining the title of an extinct monarchy can however be totally free of claims of sovereignty as when juan carlos i of spain includes king of jerusalem in his full title when it comes to deposed monarchs it is customary to continue the usage of their monarchical title e g constantine ii king of the hellenes as a courtesy title not a constitutional office for the duration of their lifetime however the title then dies with them and cannot be used by anyone else unless the crown is restored constitutionally some republicans take offense at this custom in spite of the fact that the same courtesy is often given to former republican heads of state too a former u s president is usually styled mr president for the rest of his life monarchs who have freely abdicated lose their right to use their former title however where a monarch abdicated under duress e g michael i of romania it is customary to see the abdication as invalid and to treat them as deposed monarchs entitled to use their monarchical style for their lifetime inventing a new title this is common by founders of micronations and also may or may not come with a claim of sovereignty when it does it is most often disregarded by state leaders a notable example is paddy roy bates styling himself the prince of sealand but not recognized as such by any national government thus failing at least the constitutive condition for statehood

sovereign duchy county barony grand children have the title princely like princely lord succession succession from one monarch to another varies from country to country traditionally hereditary succession within members of one family has been most common the usual hereditary succession has based on some cognatic principles and on seniority though also merits have influenced thus the most common hereditary system in feudal europe was based on cognatic primogeniture where a lord was succeeded by his eldest son and failing sons by either daughters or by sons of daughters the system of tanistry was semi elective and gave weight also to merits and capability the quasi salic succession provided firstly male members of the family to succeed and secondarily males also from female lines in most feudal fiefs females such as daughters and sisters were allowed to succeed brothers failing but usually the husband of the heiress became the real lord and most often also got title jure uxoris great britain and spain are today continuing this old model of succession law in form of cognatic primogeniture in more complex medieval cases the sometimes conflicting principles of proximity and primogeniture battled and outcomes could have been idiosyncratic as the average life span increased lords limited their own participation in dangerous battles and society s more wealthy had increasingly better sustenance and living conditions which improved general health among princes primogeniture began to win the battle against proximity tanistry seniority and election later when lands were strictly divided among noble families and tended to remain fixed agnatic primogeniture practically the same as salic law became the most usual succession going to the eldest son of the monarch if the monarch had no sons the throne would pass to the nearest male relative through male line some countries however accepted female rulers early on so that if the monarch had no sons the throne would pass to the eldest daughter this cognatic primogeniture was the rule that let elizabeth ii become queen in one nine eight zero sweden became the first european monarchy to abolish this preference for males altogether declaring equal primogeniture or full cognatic primogeniture so that the eldest child of the monarch now ascends to the throne be that child male or female other kingdoms norway in one nine nine zero belgium in one nine nine one and the netherlands have followed in some monarchies e g saudi arabia succession to the throne has passed to the monarch s next eldest brother and only to the monarch s children after that agnatic seniority in some other monarchies e g jordan the monarch chooses who will be his successor who need not necessarily be his eldest

for related meanings see also monarch disambiguation a monarchy from the greek monos one and archein to rule is a form of government that has a monarch as head of state one of the distinguishing characteristics of monarchy is that the head of state usually reigns for life in a republic the head of state often called the president is normally elected for a certain amount of time there are currently two nine extant monarchies in the world the term monarchy is also used to refer to the people especially the dynasty also known as royalty and institutions that make up the royal or imperial establishment or to the realm over which the monarch reigns in most monarchies the monarch serves as a symbol of continuity and statehood many monarchies are constituted by tradition or by codified law so that the monarch has little real politcal power but in others the monarch holds substantial power in some cases the symbolism of monarchy alongside the symbolism of democracy can lead to divisions over seemingly contradictory principles of sovereignty monarchies are one of the oldest forms of government with echoes in the leadership of tribal chiefs many monarchies began with the monarch as the local representative and temporary embodiment of the deity king of babylon the monarch often ruled at the pleasure of the deity and was overthrown or sacrificed when it became apparent that supernatural sanction had been withdrawn emperor of china mayan kings achaemenid king of kings of persia other monarchs derived their power by acclamation of the ruling or of the warrior caste of a clan or group of clans kings of the franks roman emperors even where law is simply the monarch s will the king must rule by custom since one eight zero zero many of the world s monarchies have ceased to have a monarch and become republics or become parliamentary democracies democratic countries which retain monarchy have by definition limited the monarch s power with most having become constitutional monarchies in england this process began with the magna carta of one two one five although it did not reach democratic proportions until after the glorious revolution in one six eight nine among the few states that have absolute monarchies are swaziland brunei bhutan saudi arabia and kuwait in jordan and morocco the monarch retains considerable power there are also recent two zero zero three developments in liechtenstein wherein the regnant prince was given the constitutional power to dismiss the government at will nepal saw several contradictory trends related to the violent rebel movement and the killings by the suicidal crown prince types of monarchy in an absolute monarchy the monarch has power over every aspect of the state and a constitution may be granted or withdrawn while in a constitutional monarchy he is subject to it as well as any citizen though it may grant him such priviliges as inviolability modern versions tend to survive only in societies with sufficient technology to allow the concentration and organization of power but not to allow education and rapid communication the economic structure of such monarchies is often of concentrated wealth with the majority of the population living either as agricultural serfs or as in gulf monarchies a paternalistic model showering benefits on the citizens while politically they may remain subjects and importing cheap foreign labor in some cases a hereditary monarchy exists but actual power resides in the military as often has been the case in thailand and japan see shogun in fascist italy a monarchy coexisted with a fascist party for longer than such co existences occurred in romania hungary or greece spain under francisco franco was officially a monarchy even though there was no monarch on the throne upon his death franco was succeeded as head of state by king juan carlos there have also been situations in which a dictator proclaimed himself monarch of a previous republic thus starting a self proclaimed monarchy with no historical ties to a previous dynasty the most famous example of this was general napoleon bonaparte who created himself emperor of france formerly a kingdom after legally assuming political control of the french republic as first consul for life a blatant imitation of his empire was that of bokassa i in the very poor central african empire on several occasions throughout history the same person has served as monarch of separate independent states in a situation known as a personal union an empire was traditionally ruled by a monarchy whose leader may have been known by different titles in his different realms several former colonies of the british empire such as australia canada jamaica and new zealand continue to recognize the british monarch as their own under a separate title for each country in other cases such as england and scotland a personal union was the precursor to a merger of the states succession the rules for selection of monarchs varies from country to country in constitutional monarchies the rule of succession is generally embodied in a law passed by a representative body such as a parliament elective monarchies distinguished by the monarchs being appointed for life have in most cases been succeeded by hereditary monarchies but both secular sovereign nation cases at present those of malaysia and the united arab emirates are two zero th century creations in the hereditary system the position of monarch involves inheritance according to an order of succession usually within one royal family tracing its origin back to a historical dynasty or bloodline in some cases the ruling family may claim to hold authority by virtue of god s choosing as reflected in the stle phrase by the grace of god or other religion based authority the order of succession in most european monarchical states of the two one st century is by primogeniture meaning the eldest son of the monarch is first in line followed by his male then female siblings in order of age in earlier times the succession was often unclear and this led to a number of wars currently there is some controversy over the succession laws of some monarchies in the european union eu such as that of the united kingdom uk or the scandinavian monarchies which require their monarch to be of a certain faith in the uk under the act of settlement one seven zero one this has been challenged as violating eu rules that prohibit religious disqualification for positions of state authority some autocratic states can appear to have introduced inheritance for the head of state without declaring themselves to be monarchies such as syria and north korea see family dictatorship destruction of monarchies monarchies can come to an end in several ways there may be a revolution in which the monarchy is overthrown or as in italy there may be a referendum in which the electorate decides to form a republic in some cases as with england and spain the monarchy has been overthrown and then restored although it should be noted presently neither monarchy holds political power countries may regard themselves as monarchies even without an actual monarch on the vacant throne as spain did from one nine four seven to one nine seven five and hungary from one nine two zero to one nine four four a person who claims to be the legitimate heir to a deposed or is in the royalist view suspended monarchy is called a pretender see also abolished monarchies for a list of recently abolished monarchies unusual examples sometimes component members of federal states are monarchies even though the federal state as a whole is not for example each of the emirates that form the united arab emirates has its own monarch an emir another unique situation is malaysia in which the federal king called the yang di pertuan agong or paramount ruler is elected for a five year term from and by the nine sultans who are the hereditary rulers of the states of the malay peninsula in addition to his spiritual role as supreme pontiff the pope is the absolute monarch of the vatican city he is elected by and customarily from among the college of cardinals since the catholic episcopate is celibate naturally there can be no official hereditary succession to the papal throne notwithstanding this the papacy has often been under the control of powerful italian families several popes have been succeeded by near relatives in some cases by their own sons officially described as nephews the world s only co principality andorra has two co princes the bishop of urgell in spain thus a prince bishop and the president of france a unique case where an independent country s monarch is democratically elected by the citizens of another country which is not even in full personal union samoa is often disputably described as a monarchy the president for life or o le ao o le malo is malietoa tanumafili ii a member of one of the three princely families the constitution designates him head of state for life with a royal style but he will be succeeded by an elected president current monarchies there are currently four four active monarchies in the world one six of

or modified with the purpose of making music in principle anything that produces sound and can somehow be controlled by a musician can serve as a musical instrument the expression however is reserved generally to items that have a specific musical purpose the academic study of musical instruments is called organology types of musical instruments instruments are often divided by the way in which they generate sound wind instruments generate a sound when a column of air is made to vibrate inside them the frequency of the wave generated is related to the length of the column of air and the shape of the instrument while the tone quality of the sound generated is affected by the construction of the instrument and method of tone production the group is typically subdivided into brass and woodwind instruments percussion instruments create sound with or without pitch when struck the shape and material of the part of the instrument to be struck and the shape of the resonating cavity if any determine the sound of the instrument string instruments generate a sound when the string is plucked strummed slapped etc the frequency of the wave generated and therefore the note produced usually depends on the length of the vibrating portion of the string its mass the tension of each string and the point at which the string is excited the tone quality varies with the construction of the resonating cavity voice that is the human voice is an instrument in its own right a singer generates sounds when airflow from the lungs sets the vocal cords into oscillation the fundamental frequency is controlled by the tension of the vocal cords and the tone quality by the formation of the vocal tract a wide range of sounds can be created electronic instruments generate sound through electronic means they often mimic other instruments in their design particularly keyboards keyboard instruments are any instruments that are played with a musical keyboard every key generates one or more sounds most keyboard instruments have extra means pedals for a piano stops for an organ to manipulate these sounds they may produce sound by wind organ vibrating strings either hammered piano or plucked harpsichord by electronic means synthesizer or in some other way sometimes instruments that do not usually have a keyboard such as the glockenspiel are fitted with one many alternate divisions and further subdivisions of instruments exist to learn about a specific instruments consult the list of musical instruments or list of archaic musical instruments history all classes of instruments save the electronic are mentioned in ancient sources such as egyptian inscriptions and the bible and probably predate recorded history the human body generating both voice and percussive sounds may have been the first instrument or perhaps found percussion instruments such as stones and hollow logs for instance nine thousand year old bone flutes or recorders have been found in chinese

scuba diving and industrial breathing sets nemrod twin hose diving regulator made in the one nine eight zero s its mouthpiece can be strapped in in breathing sets a mouthpiece is a part that the user grips in his mouth to make a watertight seal between the breathing set and his mouth it is composed of a short flattened oval tube that goes in between the lips with on its free end a flange that fits between the lips and the tooth and gums on the flange there are two projections with enlarged ends which are gripped between the teeth most sport diving scuba sets use a mouthpiece rather than a fullface mask in many industrial breathing sets and a few scuba sets e g the siebe gorman salvus and a one nine eight zero s model of twin hose diving regulator made by nemrod the mouthpiece also has an outer rubber flange that fits outside the lips and extends into two straps that fasten together behind the neck that makes the mouthpiece more airtight and watertight and helps to keep the mouthpiece in if the user lets his lips or jaws get slack through unconsciousness or absent mindedness or being preoccupied with work a mouthpiece in the mouth prevents clear speech as a result many work divers and many people who use a breathing set on land e g firefighters use a fullface mask in a loop of wide breathing tubes like in a twin hose aqualung or some rebreathers the word mouthpiece is sometimes taken as including the whole of the rigid assembly between the two flexible tubes musical instruments on wind instruments the mouthpiece is that part of the instrument which is placed in or next to the player s mouth in conjunction with the player s lips and on many woodwind instruments a reed it produces the basic musical tones that characterize each particular instrument from the single reed of the clarinet or saxophone to the flared turned brass tube of the horns such as the horn trumpet trombone tuba and the bugle mouthpieces are human machine interfaces designed to transmit the maximum musical information from the mouth lips tongue and lungs of the performer into the air column of the instrument on the performer s side mouthpiece must be matched to embouchure the exact way of setting the mouth parts to transmit the maximum of musical information to the mouthpiece thus the mouthpiece attached to its instrument is a means of extending the expressive power of the upper body the typical mouthpiece is capable of playing only a few notes on its own often with poor tone by varying the air column in a myriad of ingenious ways these few notes are transformed into many notes of many tones on the various instruments brass instruments trumpet mouthpiece from the side in western instruments of the european classical tradition there are several different kinds of mouthpiece one of the most common is the one seen on brass instruments which is a type also used on several non western instruments this consists of a simple circular opening which leads to the main body of the instrument the player vibrates his lips while they are placed on this opening this causes the column of air contained within the instrument to vibrate in a standing wave pattern cut away view of trumpet mouthpiece one inner rim diameter two rim width three rim contour four rim edge five cup six throat seven backbore eight shank the mouthpiece of many brass instruments including the trumpet and trombone is cup shaped although the horn s mouthpiece is simpler being only slightly flared the degree of flaring and the exact shape of the cup five if present can greatly affect the timbre of the instrument the width of the opening one in the mouthpiece also has an effect a mouthpiece with a narrow bore seven is generally preferred by brass players who concentrate on the upper range of their instrument and a wider bore by those who emphasize the lower range of their instrument in their playing reed instruments clarinet mouthpiece the mouthpiece on a single reed instrument such as the clarinet or saxophone is quite different these mouthpieces are basically wedge shaped with the reed being placed against the flat surface or the table closest to the player s bottom lip here the player s breath causes the reed to vibrate which in turn sets the column of air contained within the instrument in vibration near the top of the mouthpiece there is a small opening into the inside of the instrument as with the brass instruments the shape of the bore immediately beyond the opening can greatly affect the sound of the instrument on some woodwind instruments the bore here is a simple extension of the main body of the instrument although it is possible to widen it by various means mouthpieces with large rounded chambers will produce a quite different sound than one with a small or square chamber most mouthpieces are made out of metal hard rubber or plastic rubber although one of the most common materials for mouthpieces often lacks in durability warps over time and has a tendency to break when bumped with mouthpieces of any material the tip may eventually wear down from reed vibration the double reed of the oboe or bassoon is not generally referred to as a mouthpiece but serves the same function as the mouthpiece reed combination on a single reed instrument it is placed in the player s mouth and supplies the initial vibration which starts the air column vibrating while a double reed consists of two reeds vibrating against eachother the single reed plus mouthpiece has a reed vibrating against a mouthpiece see also scuba set musical instrument smoking

industrialized towns of scandinavia but has in recent decades been struggling with the adaption to post industrialism by the dawn of the two one st century malm had become sweden s most multi ethnic city with two four of the population born abroad with more than a third being first or second generation immigrants and the proportion of muslims estimated to be one six with its old buildings and many parks it appears appealing to outsiders and is also a popular place to shop due to its many different shops and stores during the last few years a university college malm h gskola has been established and the city is now focussing extensively on education arts and culture history st petri church malm in one five eight zero in a german map book malm is held to have been founded in what was then denmark in the one three th century as a fortified quay or ferry berth of the archbishop of lund some two zero kilometers north east its original name was malmhaug sandpile but in the middle ages german merchants from l beck settled there and named it elbogen elbow for the curve at its shoreline that existed at the point around one two nine zero construction on the st petri church began it was the first gothic church to be built within sweden s present day borders similar brick gothic churches can be found around the coastal regions of both sweden and germany for example in ystad landskrona and rostock and were inspired by the german sea merchants the hanseatic league who played a major part in the economical growths around the sound red bricks were used instead of stone due to its scarcity in the area and the color comes from the bedrock and the means the bricks were fabricated in the ensuing century malm and copenhagen would rise in economic importance and until this day this pattern has persisted despite lund and to a lesser degree roskilde being culturally of much greater importance malm and copenhagen have been centers for industrious and economic success the disunity between the burghers of lund and malm has remained a fundamental characteristic the former relying on tradition the latter on modernity and adaption malm was for instance a leading hanseatic town during the decades of the hansa s dominance in the region and leading the process of protestant reformation in denmark of the one five three zero s after the secession to sweden in one six five eight malm suffered an economic decline due to poor harbour facilities and loss of trading privileges that were granted under the danish crown by one seven three zero its population had dwindled to two eight two in one seven seven five a new harbour was constructed but malm s economic status remained poor until the later part of one nine th century and the introduction of the railroad the first fortification was erected at the site of skeppsbron ship bridge and malm central station first hinted at in unfriendly diplomatic correspondence between the king and the archbishop in march one two five six but in one four three four malm s growth gave reason to the erection of a new citadel at the beach south of the town the new fortress malm hus was completed in the mid one six th century and continued to play an essential role after the secession to sweden now as a part of the defense system against the danes during one eight two eight one nine one four the building was re used as a prison and since the one nine three zero s it houses malm museum malm hus castle now housing malm museum heraldry the city arms were granted in one four three seven by king eric of pomerania the arms

system the tramlines streetcars were however abolished in one nine seven three a swedish deregulation of taxicabs in the one nine nine zero s turned out particularly advantageous for malm the supply of cabs is good and most operate to low fixed fares usually arriving within three four minutes if requested by phone which is the most convenient for tourists however it s advisable to compare prices malm municipality consists of malm and its immediate surroundings it is an administrative unit defined by purely geographical borders in all official contexts the town malm calls itself malm stad or

economy of malm was traditionally based on shipbuilding kockums and construction related industries such as concrete factories the region s leading university with associated hi tech and pharmaceutical industry is located in lund about one six km to the north east as a result malm had a troubled economic situation following the mid one nine seven zero s however during the last few

was dreadful since he could not find any open bar or cinema thus there was nothing to do except staying in the hotel room waiting for the ferry back to copenhagen this was asserted by several other visitor to malm during the last decades but with the closure of the ship industry of kockums and the new connection to copenhagen see oresund bridge the image of the city has been transformed into a positive one as new cultural institutions such as theaters and opera house were opened the inauguration of malm university has attracted many students who also chose to settle in malm due to the limitation of housing in nearby lund sports the best known football soccer team in malm is malm ff who play in the top level allsvenskan they had their period of glamour in the one nine seven zero s and one nine eight zero s when they won the league several times in one nine seven nine they advanced to the finals of the european cup now the uefa champions league the one nine nine zero s brought them nothing but difficulties culminating in relegation in one nine nine nine although they would return to the top flight at the first opportunity however several of the players with a foreign

of sk ne county municipalities of sweden sk ne south sk ne southwestern scania towns in sweden various meters in classical physics and engineering measurement generally refers to the process of estimating or determining the ratio of a magnitude of a quantitative property or relation to a unit of the same type of quantitative property or relation a process of measurement involves the comparison of physical quantities of objects or phenomena or the comparison of relations between objects e g angles a particular measurement is the result of such a process normally expressed as the multiple of a real number and a unit where the real number is the ratio obtained from the measurement process for example the measurement of the length of an object might be five m which is an estimate of the object s length a magnitude relative to a unit of length the meter measurement is not limited to physical quantities and relations but can in principle extend to the quantification of a magnitude of any type through application of a measurement model such as the rasch model and subjecting empirical data derived from comparisons to appropriate testing in order to ascertain whether specific criteria for measurement have been satisfied in addition the term measurement is often used in a somewhat looser fashion than defined above to refer to any process in which numbers are assigned to entities such that the numbers are intended to represent increasing amount in some sense without a process that involves the estimation of ratios of magnitudes to a unit such examples of measurement range from degrees of uncertainty to consumer confidence to the rate of increase in the fall in the price of a good or service it is generally proposed that there are four different levels of measurement and that different levels are applicable to different contexts and types of measurement process in scientific research measurement is essential it includes the process of collecting data which can be used to make claims about learning measurement is also used to evaluate the effectiveness of a program or product known as an evaluand a measurement is a comparison to a standard william shockley by number we understand not so much a multitude of unities as the abstracted ratio of any quantity to another quantity of the same kind which we take for unity sir isaac newton one seven two eight units and systems of measurement main articles units of measurement and systems of measurement because measurement involves the estimation of magnitudes of quantities relative to particular quantities called units the specification of units is of fundamental importance to measurement the definition or specification of precise standards of measurement involves two key features which are evident in the syst me international d unit s si specifically in this system the definition of each of the base units makes reference to specific empirical conditions and with the exception of the kilogram also to other quantitative attributes each derived si unit is defined purely in terms of a relationship involving itself and other units for example the unit of velocity is one m s due to the fact that derived units make reference to base units the specification of empirical conditions is an implied component of the definition of all units the measurement of a specific entity or relation results in at least two numbers for the relationship between the entity or relation under study and the referenced unit of measurement where at least one number estimates the statistical uncertainty in the measurement also referred to as measurement error measuring instruments are used to estimate ratios of magnitudes to units prior comparisons underlie the calibration in terms of standard units of commonly used instruments constructed to measure physical quantities metrology metrology is the study of measurement in general a metric is a scale of measurement defined in terms of a standard i e in terms of well defined unit the quantification of phenomena through the process of measurement relies on the existence of an explicit or implicit metric which is the standard to which measurements are referenced if one says i am five that person is indicating a measurement without supplying an applicable standard he could mean i am five years old or i am five feet high however the implicit metric is that he is five years old history main article history of measurement laws to regulate measurement were originally developed to prevent fraud however units of measurement are now generally defined on a scientific basis and are established by international treaties in the united states commercial measurements are regulated by the national institute of standards and technology nist a division of the united states department of commerce the history of measurements is a topic within the history of science and technology the metre us meter was standardized as the unit for length after the french revolution and has since been adopted throughout most of the world the united states and the uk are in the process of converting to the si system this process is known as metrication difficulties in measurement measurement of many quantities is very difficult and prone to large error part of the difficulty is due to uncertainty and part of it is due to the limited time available in which to make the measurement examples of things that are very difficult to measure in some respects and for some purposes include social related items such as a person s knowledge as in testing see also assessment a person s feelings emotions or beliefs a person s senses qualia even for physical quantities gaining accurate measurement can be difficult it is not possible to be exact instead repeated measurements will vary due to various factors affecting the quantity such as temperature time electromagnetic fields and especially measurement method as an example in the measurement of the speed of light the quantity is now known to a high degree of precision due to modern methods but even with those methods there is some variability in the measurement statistical techniques are applied to the measurement samples to estimate the speed in earlier sets of measurements the variability was greater and comparing the results shows that the variability and bias in the measurement methods was not properly taken into account proof of this is that when various group s measurements are plotted with the estimated speed and error bars showing the expected variability of the estimated speed from the actual number the error bars from each of the experiments did not all overlap this means a number of groups incorrectly accounted for the true sources of error and overestimated the accuracy of their methods miscellaneous measuring the ratios between physical quantities is an important sub field of physics some important physical quantities include speed of light planck s constant gravitational constant elementary charge electric charge of electrons protons etc fine structure constant see also units of measurement systems of measurement history of

millennium island eight five zero km four six zero nmi to the southeast the island has roughly the shape of an equilateral triangle eight km on a side aligned with the southwest side running northwest to southeast the west and south corners of the triangle are slightly truncated shortening the north east and southwest coasts to about seven km and adding shorter west and south coasts about one to two km in length a large mostly shallow irregularly shaped lagoon containing a number of small islets fills the east central part of the island the lagoon is entirely enclosed by land but only by relatively narrow strips along its north and east sides most of the land area of the island lies to the south and west of the lagoon the total area of the island is about three nine three zero km the island is very low no more than one zero m above sea level at its highest point the highest elevations are found along a rim that closely follows the coastline the interior forms a depression that is only a few meters above sea level in the western part and is below sea level filled by the lagoon in the east central part because of this topography the ocean cannot be seen from much of the interior a continuous heavy surf falls all along the coast forming a narrow white to gray sandy beach except on the west coast where the white sandy beach is more extensive than elsewhere a strip of dark gray coral rubble forming a series of low ridges parallel to the coast lies within the narrow beach extending inward to the island rim history malden was discovered on three zero july one eight two five not two nine july as incorrectly reported in some sources by captain george anson lord byron a cousin of the poet byron commanding the british warship hms blonde was returning to london from a special mission to honolulu to repatriate the remains of the young king and queen of hawaii who had died tragically of measles during a visit to britain the island was named for lt charles robert malden navigator of the blonde who sighted the island and briefly explored it andrew bloxam naturalist of the blonde and james macrae a botanist travelling for the royal horticultural society joined in exploring the island and recorded their observations at the time of its discovery malden was found to be unoccupied but the remains of ruined temples and other structures indicated that the island had at one time been inhabited at various times these remains have been speculatively attributed to wrecked seamen the buccaneers the south american incas early chinese navigators etc in one nine two four the malden ruins were examined by an archaeologist from the bishop museum in honolulu k p emory who concluded that they were the creation of a small polynesian population which had resided there for perhaps several generations some centuries earlier in the first half of the nineteenth century during the heyday of american whaling in the central pacific malden was visited on a number of occasions by american whalers malden was claimed by the u s guano company under the guano islands act of one eight five six which authorized citizens to take possession of uninhabited islands under the authority of the united states for the purpose of removing guano a valuable agricultural fertilizer before the american company began operations however the island was occupied by an australian company under british license this company and its successors exploited the island continuously from the one eight six zero s through one nine two seven in one nine five six the united kingdom selected malden as the instrumentation site for its first series of thermonuclear h bomb weapons tests based at kiritimati christmas island british propagandists insisted that malden should not be called a target island nevertheless the bombing target marker was located at the south point of the island and three thermonuclear devices were detonated at high altitude a short distance offshore in one nine five seven the united states continued to dispute british sovereignty over malden until after the independence of kiribati was granted in july one nine seven nine on two zero september representatives of the united states and kiribati met on tarawa atoll in the gilberts group of kiribati and signed a treaty of friendship between their two nations commonly referred to as the treaty of tarawa of one nine seven nine by which the united states recognized kiribati s sovereignty over malden and thirteen other islands in the line and phoenix islands groups this treaty entered into force on two three september one nine eight three the main value of the island to kiribati lies in the resources of the two zero zero nautical mile three seven zero km exclusive economic zone which surrounds it particularly the rich tuna fisheries gypsum deposits on the island itself are extensive but do not appear to be economically viable under foreseeable market conditions mainly due to cost of transportation some revenue has been realized from ecotourism the world discoverer an adventure cruise ship operated by society expeditions visited the island once or twice annually for several years in the mid one nine nine zero s malden was reserved as a wildlife sanctuary and closed area officially designated the malden island wildlife sanctuary on two nine may one nine seven five under

hebrew alphabet the consonant letters yod waw and aleph were used to give a rough indication of the quality of long vowels most commonly yod indicates i or e while waw indicates o or u aleph was not systematically developed as a mater lectionis in hebrew as it was in aramaic and arabic but it is occasionally used to indicate an a vowel however a silent aleph indicating an original glottal stop consonant sound which has become silent in hebrew pronunciation can occur after almost any vowel at the end of a word he can also be used to indicate that a vowel should be pronounced in some verb forms matres lectionis are used almost always examples letternamevowel qualityexample alephmostly p r n mill hemostly or e l waw or y l b r kh yod or d w d later it became clear that the system of matres lectionis did not suffice to indicate the vowels precisely enough so that supplemental vowel pointing systems diacritic symbols indicating vowel pronunciation and other important phonological features not written by the traditional basic consonantal orthography were developed accordingly historically the practice of using matres lectionis seems to have originated when ay and aw diphthongs written using the yod and waw consonant letters respectively monophthongized to simple long vowels and this epiphenomenal association between consonant letters and vowel sounds was then seized upon and used in words without historic diphthongs in general terms it is observable that early phoenician texts have very few matres lectionis and that during most of the one st millennium b c e hebrew and aramaic were quicker to develop matres lectionis than phoenician however in its latest period of development in north africa referred to as punic the phoenician language developed a very full use of matres lectionis including the use of the letter ayin also used for this purpose much latter in yiddish orthography in pre exilic hebrew there was a significant development of the use of the letter he to indicate word final vowels other than and this was probably inspired by the phonological change of the third person singular possessive suffix from ah aw in most environments however in later periods of hebrew the orthography was changed so that word final was no longer written with the letter he except in a few archaically spelled proper names such as solomon and shiloh the difference between the spelling of the third person singular possessive suffix as attached to singular nouns with he in early hebrew vs with waw in later hebrew has become an issue in the authentication of the jehoash inscription according to sass five already in the middle kingdom there were some cases of matres lectionis i e consonant graphemes which were used to transcribe vowels in foreign words namely in punic jensen two nine zero naveh six two aramaic and hebrew he waw yod sometimes even aleph naveh six two naveh ibid notes that the earliest aramaic and hebrew documents already used matres

film wu xia film film genres martial arts films the musical film is a film genre in which several songs sung by the characters are interwoven into the narrative the songs are usually used to advance the plot or develop the film s characters a subgenre of the musical is the musical comedy which includes a strong element of humour as well as the usual music dancing and storyline the musical film was a natural development of the stage musical typically the biggest difference between film and stage musicals is the use of lavish background scenery which would be impractical in a theater musical films characteristically contain elements reminiscent of theater performers often treat their song and dance numbers as if there is a live audience watching in a sense the viewer becomes the diegetic audience as the performer looks directly into the camera and performs to it history of the musical the musical is the genre associated with the transition from silent film to sound film the concept of talking pictures had been considered a risky investment by the major hollywood studios until the warner bros studio took the leap and produced the jazz singer one nine two seven starring al jolson jolson s singing in the picture forever changed the medium of film and it jolted hollywood into the era of sound as hollywood adapted to sound films musicals were an important part of hollywood s movie output ranking alongside westerns dramas and comedies musicals of the classical sound era the one nine three zero s one nine four zero s and one nine five zero s are often considered the golden age of the musical when the genre s popularity was at its height busby berkeley during the one nine three zero s director busby berkeley began to enhance the traditional dance number with ideas drawn from the drill precision he had experienced as a soldier during the first world war in films such as four two nd street one nine three three berkeley choreographed a number of films in his unique style berkeley s numbers typically begin on a stage but gradually transcend the limitations of theatrical space his ingenious routines involving human bodies forming patterns like a kaleidoscope could never fit onto a real stage and the intended perspective is viewing from straight above berkeley s use of the female body as an erotic spectacle is regarded by many feminists today as exploitation musical stars musical stars such as fred astaire and ginger rogers were among the most popular and highly respected personalities in hollywood during the classical era the fred and ginger pairing was particularly successful resulting in a number of classic films such as top hat one nine three five swing time one nine three six and carefree one nine three eight many dramatic actors gladly participated in musicals as a way to break away from their typical typecasting for instance the multi talented james cagney had originally risen to fame as a stage singer and dancer but his repeated casting in tough guy roles and gangster movies gave him few chances to display these talents cagney s oscar winning role in yankee doodle dandy one nine four two allowed him to sing and dance and he considered it to be one of his finest moments many comedies and a few dramas included their own musical numbers the marx brothers movies included a musical number in nearly every film allowing the brothers to highlight their musical talents lalla the freed unit during the late one nine four zero s and into the one nine five zero s a production unit at metro goldwyn mayer headed by arthur freed made the transition from old fashioned musicals whose formula had become repetitive to something new recruiting his own workers mostly from broadway and the new york stage freed was responsible for bringing such talents as director vincente minnelli to the world of film starting in one nine four four with meet me in st louis the freed unit worked independently of its own studio to produce some of the most popular and well known examples of the genre the products of this unit include easter parade one nine four eight on the town one nine four nine an american in paris one nine five one singin in the rain one nine five two and the band wagon one nine five three this era allowed the greatest talents in movie musical history to flourish including judy garland gene kelly ann miller donald o connor cyd charisse jane powell howard keel and kathryn grayson fred astaire was also coaxed out of retirement for easter parade and made a permanent comeback the post classical musical the one nine five zero s musical since the one nine five zero s the musical has declined in popularity one reason was the change in culture to rock n roll and the freedom and youth associated with it elvis presley made a few movies that have been equated with the old musicals in terms of form most of the musical films of the five zero s and six zero s e g oklahoma and the sound of music were straightforward adaptations or restagings of successful stage productions the musical today the trend in modern filmmaking after the one nine six zero s has been to avoid musicals as such in favour of using music by popular rock or pop bands as background music in the hope of selling a soundtrack album to fans there are exceptions to this rule however and films about actors dancers or singers have been made as successful modern style musicals with the music as an intrinsic part of the storyline the other exception to the rule is the children s animated movie which almost always include traditional musical numbers some of which such as beauty and the beast and the lion king have later become live stage productions in the early two zero zero zero s however the musical film has begun to rise in popularity once more with new works such as moulin rouge or film remakes of stage shows such as chicago rent and the producers with the last two featuring many of the original broadway cast

official language of the european union it is derived from and most closely related to arabic apart from its phonology maltese is quite similar to urban varieties of tunisian arabic and they are in fact moderately intelligible more so than tunisian arabic is to other arabic dialects such as gulf arabic maltese also shares similarities with other north african arabic dialects however in the course of malta s recent history the language has adopted many loan words and even phonetic and phonological features from southern italian sicilian and english maltese is the only semitic language written in the latin alphabet in its standard form it is also the only semitic language native to a geopolitically european country although geophysically malta is generally regarded as forming part of the african continental plate maltese became an official language of malta in one nine three six alongside english before that year the official language of malta was italian today there are an estimated three three zero zero zero zero maltese speakers there are a significant number of maltese expatriates in australia the united states and canada who can still speak the language the oldest known document in maltese is il cantilena a poem from the one five th century written by pietro caxaro for centuries maltese was nearly exclusively a spoken language with writing being done in arabic or later italian grammar its basis is arabic with a very large influx of romance vocabulary especially sicilian and norman french although influenced by romance languages maltese grammar is still strongly semitic adjectives follow nouns there are no separately formed native adverbs and word order is fairly flexible as in arabic and hebrew both nouns and adjectives those of semitic origin take the definite article for example l art l imqaddsa lit the land the holy the holy land cf arabic al ar al muqaddasa hebrew ha arets hakkedo a this rule does not apply to nouns and adjectives of romance origin nouns are pluralized and also have a dual marker rare among modern european languages others including icelandic slovene and sorbian verbs still show a triliteral semitic pattern in which a verb is conjugated with prefixes suffixes and infixes for example ktibna arabic katabna hebrew katavnu we wrote there are two tenses present and perfect the maltese verb system incorporates romance verbs and adds arabic suffixes and prefixes to them for example idde idejna we decided i dde ieda romance verb ejna arabic first person plural perfect marker arabic only rarely does this although several arabic dialects like tunisian do maltese grammar generally shows two patterns a semitic pattern and a romance pattern usage being selected by word origin and tradition an anglo saxon pattern in the form of english words adapted to a maltese structure is a recent linguistic phenomenon the romance pattern is generally simpler words of romance origin are usually pluralized in two manners addition of i or jiet for example lingwa lingwi languages art artijiet lands territorial possessions or property semitic plurals however are much more complex if they are regular they are marked by iet ijiet cf arabic at and hebrew ot or in cf arabic n and hebrew im if irregular they fall in the pluralis fractus category in which a word is pluralized by internal vowel changes ktieb kotba books ra el ir iel men this is very well developed in arabic and also exhibited by hebrew sefer sfarim books vocabulary maltese vocabulary is a hybrid based on a foundation of arabic semitic roots with a heavy borrowing of sicilian rather than tuscan italian loanwords in this respect it is similar to english a germanic language heavily influenced by french and persian an indo iranian language heavily influenced by arabic it is estimated that six zero of the vocabulary is semitic the rest being romance usually words expressing basic concepts and ideas are of arabic origin whereas more learned words having to do with new ideas objects government law education art literature and general learning are derived from sicilian thus words like ra el man mara woman tifel child dar house xemx sun sajf summer are of arabic origin while words like skola school gvern government repubblika republic re king natura nature pulizija police entru center teatru theater differenza difference are derived from sicilian the perverse result of this highly uneven distribution of loanwords throughout the language is that a speaker of the loanword source language in this case romance language speakers can understand for instance the main page of the maltese wikipedia or know the subject of a newspaper article but cannot understand even such basic things as the man is in the house this situation resembles that of a monolingual english speaker who will often be able to guess the content of something in french if it s formal academic writing but not understand much simpler sentences romance words usually reflect sicilian and not tuscan pronunciation thus final o becomes u in maltese after sicilian e g teatru not teatro as in tuscan also final italian e becomes i arti art fidi faith lokali local cf italian arte fede locale this effect is also found in brazilian portuguese english sh is written x and this produces interesting spellings ambaxxata is embassy xena is scene cf italian

nubia museum mormon is a colloquial term used to refer to members of most of the forms of christianity within the latter day saint movement which began during the one eight three zero s and in the united states the term is derived from the title of the movement s best known book of scripture the book of mormon its compiler gave his name as mormon and describes himself as living at a time that would fall in the four th century the word is also an adjective referring to various cultural and religious aspects of mormonism the largest and best known mormon denomination is the church of jesus christ of latter day saints lds church the largest and most well known denomination within the latter day saint movement who are also sometimes called latter day saints or lds origin of the term mormon the term mormon and its related terms were first used in modern times in the one eight three zero s for those who believed that joseph smith jr had been called as a prophet of god and who accepted the book of mormon as scripture translated by joseph smith the book of mormon is self described as a compilation of smaller books compiled edited and abridged by a prophet historian named mormon hence the title of the book joseph smith jr in a letter to the editor of times and seasons defines the term mormon as meaning more good the first usage chronologically of the word mormon in the book of mormon is in reference to a place which was called mormon that had a fountain of pure water where alma taught the people who were desirous to come into the fold of god and baptized them in the waters of mormon after the initial publishing of the book mormon originated as a derogatory term referring to those who believed in the book of mormon but the name soon lost most of its negative connotation and is generally not considered offensive today throughout the one nine th and early two zero th centuries the related terms mormonite mormonist mormonish mormonic and mormoness were used but such terms are now very rare and may be considered somewhat offensive scope of the term mormon within the latter day saint movement some scholars feel the terms mormon and mormonism are useful to collectively describe all denominations within the latter day saint movement who originate from the religion founded by joseph smith jr however some feel the terms mormon and mormonism should be used exclusively to refer to the church of jesus christ of latter day saints the lds church which is by far the largest latter day saint denomination members of the community of christ formerly the reorganized church of jesus christ of latter day saints which separated from the church of jesus christ of latter day saints in nauvoo illinois rarely use the term mormon to describe themselves and instead apply it to members of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints the associated press stylebook likewise notes the term mormon is not properly applied to the other churches that resulted from the split after joseph smith s death however this usage is problematic because mormon is employed by members of other schisms of the early latter day saint movement that were prior to the succession crisis mormon is also used by some schisms that split from the lds church in the two zero th century however these groups often refer to themselves as mormon fundamentalists and call members of the lds church mainstream mormons the more general guidelines of the ap stylebook recommend that people should be called by those labels with which they self identify in addition to those members of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints who seek for that denomination to be the only denomination referred to as mormon other members of that church disapprove of the term mormon and prefer instead to be called latter day saints or lds many members of that denomination also use the term lds when speaking to fellow church members and mormon when speaking to others the phrase mormon church also generally refers colloquially to this denomination which maintains an official website presenting its basic beliefs and tenets at www mormon org and another website directed more at church members at www lds org therefore the only universally accepted terminology in referring to latter day saint denominations is to use the full name of the church and to refer to individual latter day saints as members or adherents of their particular denomination use of the term mormon by the church of jesus christ of latter day saints the church of jesus christ of latter day saints with whom the term mormon is most commonly identified has changed its position on the term mormon over time for many years it was common for members to use quotes around the word mormon to indicate that this is something non mormons called latter day saints by the one nine seven zero s the term had become so common the lds church began to use the term mormon in advertising including well known television commercials which ended a message from the church of jesus christ of latter day saints the mormons more recently the organization has asked the media to use the church s complete name and follow any second reference with the name the church of jesus christ to recognize jesus christ s importance to the faith this style suggestion is rarely followed because of the ambiguity of the abbreviation and most still use the previous abbreviation lds church although the lds church objects to the use of the referent mormon church it stops short of rejecting the terms mormonism and mormon and occasionally claims these terms as exclusive references only to itself and its members in a press release from two zero zero one the lds church stated that the word mormon as an adjective in such expressions as mormon pioneers mormons as a noun in reference to church members and mormonism as a doctrine culture and lifestyle were all acceptable claims for exclusivity of usage are primarily to avoid confusion between the lds church and mormon fundamentalist groups the lds church argues mormon mormon fundamentalist and mormon dissident in reference to organizations or groups outside of the lds church especially those that practice plural marriage is a misunderstanding of mormon theology in particular the principle of continuous revelation and priesthood authority members of the lds church who are found guilty of practicing polygamy are excommunicated from the church despite this perspective the term mormon fundamentalist is widely used by latter day saints in some areas including members of the lds church and the fundamentalists themselves and by people outside the movement however this is strongly discouraged by the current president of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints gordon b hinckley sometimes restorationist or restoration movement are used as umbrella terms for those derived from the campbellites or stone campbell churches for example the church of christ and the disciples of christ mormons however while sharing some general beliefs of the campbellites are not a break off group of the campbellites but instead a group which believes that a restoration of the original church of jesus christ known as the primitive church by historians has taken place as god called joseph smith to be a prophet independent of any other church or movement there are some general similarities to campbellite teachings and many of mormonism s first adherents including sidney rigdon were previously campbellites but the book of mormon and the book of doctrine and covenants define the mormons doctrine in a unique way from any other restoration movement body utah mormons and missouri mormons some scholars such as melton in his encyclopedia of american religion subdivide the mormons into utah mormons and missouri mormons however these terms are not of common usage and even unheard of among the majority of those who call themselves mormons in this scheme the utah mormon group includes all the organizations descending from those mormons who followed brigham young to what is now utah the church of jesus christ of latter day saints is by far the largest of these groups and the only group to initially reside in utah when the united states outlawed plural marriage the church established a few mormon colonies like colonia ju rez in mexico as plural marriage was still legal there when the leaders of the lds church proclaimed that god had revealed to them that the practice of plural marriage was to be discontinued october six one eight nine zero however there were a number of families who left the church of jesus christ of latter day saints and continued to practice plural marriage in scattered and usually isolated communities while these smaller groups have a membership in the thousands the church of jesus christ of latter day saints now claims a world wide membership of over one two million but due to heavy media focus on these fractional bodies misidentification of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints with these polygamous groups is not uncommon these groups include the fundamentalist church of jesus christ of latter day saints the kingston clan the true utah mormons and missouri mormons are problematic because the majority of members of each of these branches no longer live in either of these states while the majority of the population of the state of utah are members of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints it has a large membership in many other states most notably arizona california idaho and nevada the majority of the membership of the church today resides outside of the united states the missouri mormons are those mormons who did not travel to utah and the organizations formed from them the community of christ church of christ temple lot remnant church of jesus christ of latter day saints etc not all missouri mormon groups are based in missouri however notable exceptions include the pennsylvania based church of jesus christ bickertonite which considers sidney rigdon joseph smith s rightful successor and the wisconsin based church of jesus christ of latter day saints strangite which considers james j strang smith s legitimate successor addressing some of the limitations of the utah missouri designations historian jan shipps has now coined the terms rocky mountain saints and prairie saints to rename the utah and missouri branches of the movement these new terms have begun to gain a following among some historians today but similar to the above mentioned titles they are not of common usage among the majority of those who call themselves mormons distinctions from other religious groups despite some misconceptions over similar nicknames and stereotypes mormons are not the same religious group as quakers members of the religious society of friends mennonites or amish mormons originated separately from these groups and are distinct in culture practice and theology mormonism originated in the united states the quaker and mennonite faiths originally came from europe the groups also have numerous doctrinal differences for example both quakers and mennonites which include the amish are traditionally strict pacifists and are both peace churches whereas mormons believe in self defense and will participate in the military in the united states many mormons are members of the armed forces and there are lds chaplains one source of confusion in regions where spanish french russian polish or italian are the predominant languages comes from a mistranslation in the film witness starring harrison ford into spanish french russian polish and italian amish was translated incorrectly to mormon how this happened with different translators into different languages is not clear but demonstrates a general misunderstanding about the identity of either the amish or the mormons or both mormons as public figures and in popular culture see also list of latter day saints mormons depicted in movies and television are often presented as a stereo type blond haired caucasians having large families are very religious with a focus on genealogy and fundamentalism more recent productions with the intent of presenting a more accurate picture of their culture have demonstrated that their religion is inclusive representing a vast spectrum of ethnic backgrounds the emphasis on genealogy is not surprising given the immense importance genealogical research www familysearch org has in mormon culture including in particular as a point of outreach contact with non mormons they have been both objects of ridicule in comedic media tonight show south park and other tv shows and other films usually making fun of the lds church s history and doctrines including

everest is above sea level the trench has a maximum depth of one zero nine one one m three five seven nine eight feet below sea level taking into account its latitude and the earth s equatorial bulge this puts it at six three six six four km from the centre of the earth the arctic ocean on the other hand is four four five km deep which would put its floor at six three five two eight km from the earth s centre one three six km closer it was first surveyed in one nine five one by the british navy vessel challenger ii which gave its name to the deepest part of the trench the challenger deep

the stylus passed across the graduated depth scale whilst the timing of the speed of the echo sounding machine a necessary part of the process was made with a hand held stopwatch for these reasons it

ancient macedonian language the macedonian language makedonski is a language in the eastern group of south slavic languages and is the official language of the republic of macedonia macedonian is also spoken in serbia and montenegro albania bulgaria greece and in the macedonian diasporas in western europe north america and australia the total number of native macedonian speakers is estimated around two three million not to be confused with the ancient macedonian language the modern slavic macedonian language is closely related to bulgarian macedonian also has similarities with serbian particularly old serbian torlakian dialect bulgarian and macedonian share typological similarities with romanian greek and albanian these five languages make up the balkan language league even though they are all from different language families romanian is a romance language while greek and albanian comprise their own branches in the indo european family macedonian is the official language in the republic of macedonia and officially recognized in the district of kor in albania native speakers are also found in serbia and montenegro greece bulgaria and albania also the kosovo government announced that the gorani people from southern kosovo gora region will receive school education in the macedonian language as of two zero zero six along with bulgarian macedonian is the only slavic language not to use noun cases except for vocative and to have a definite article a modified cyrillic script macedonian cyrillic with three one letters is used for writing while the transliteration to latin script is easy in principle there is currently a lot of confusion about which standard to use when macedonia was part of former yugoslavia macedonian was typically written using the latin script used for serbo croatian for example the cyrillic letter was written as since then the use of zh or simply z has gained currency especially problematic is the cyrillic letter which can be found transliterated into latin as d dzh dz or even x the macedonian language is taught as a subject in several of the university centres of the world and is currently taught in all universities of the former yugoslavia history one of the varieties of old church slavonic the one of the ohrid literary school one of the literary schools of the first bulgarian empire from the one zero th century on and written primarily in glagolitic is sometimes regarded as macedonian due to it being based on the local slavic vernacular of the region there were three schools of macedonian linguists in the recent history of slavic macedonia the first one was called the bulgarophiles and it tried to reach the linguistical and political unity with bulgaria this group tried in the one nine th century accompanied by pan slavic nationalism to make the first attempt to resolve the question of linguistic norms in what they considered the bulgarian macedonian diasystem bulgarophile writers from macedonia kuzman apkarev miladinov brothers grigor prlichev advocated a common bulgarian language based on the slavic dialects in macedonia or on a compromise between the upper bulgarian northeastern bulgarian and the western macedonian dialects which they considered as bulgarian writers from northern bulgaria however insisted on the adoption of the northeastern bulgarian dialect only the establishment of an autonomous bulgarian principality north of the stara planina led eventually to the adoption of the eastern literary variant still even after the codification of the bulgarian language in one eight nine nine the preservation of the letters and with dialect dependant double reading allowed some differences between eastern bulgarian and western bulgarian and macedonian dialects within the codified norm at the same time the serbian scholars and a part of intellectuals from macedonia called the serbophiles considered the macedonian language merely a southernmost dialect of serbian language thus forcing this idea that become prevalent in vardar macedonia after the balkan wars and world war i between the world wars in serbia macedonian dialects was treated as a serbian dialects literary serbo croatian was the language of education media and public life even so macedonian literature was tolerated as a local dialectal folkloristic form the serbophile idea was later abandoned in favour of the formation of separate macedonian language in one nine four four when the third group of linguists led by bla e koneski codified the macedonian literary language the idea of the separate macedonian language which is neither bulgarian nor serbian in essence is called macedonism and it has been official nowadays macedonian shares similar features both with serbian lexical fund slang script present tense forms accentuation position through unrelated processes stress in both languages has generally come to be placed closer to the beginning of the word than in their eastern neighbour etc and bulgarian virtually complete lack of cases definite article formation of future tense non melodical accent etc but also posesses some unique features source victor a friedman p one five dialects a

issue of macedonian ethnicity the politicians linguists and common people from macedonia and neighboring countries have opposing views about the existence and distinctivity of the macedonian language macedonian dialects are indeed a part of dialectal continuum which stretches from croatian bosnian and serbian shtokavian dialect through torlakian on the northwest to western and eastern bulgarian dialects on the east like many other languages macedonian language is just a standardized form of a group of dialect s according to the macedonian view now prevalent and official in the books in republic of macedonia macedonian was the first official language of the slavs thanks to the st cyril and st methodius s introduction of slavic literacy language through the glagolitic script that was based confirmed by britannica on the southern macedonian dialect of thessaloniki solun bulgarian and serbian views state each in its own favor that macedonian is a modern coinage which merely denotes the western bulgarian or southern serbian dialects of the area and that the macedonian language is merely a dialect of their respective languages bulgarian and some international linguists view macedonian as another literary form of bulgarian malherbe m one nine nine five les langages de l humanit paris robert laffont although bulgaria was the first country to recognize the independence of the republic of macedonia it has refused to recognize the existence of a separate macedonian nation and a separate macedonian language serbia gradually accepted both although extreme nationalistic views still exist on the other hand the name of the language is considered offensive by many greeks who assert that the ancient macedonian language is the only macedonian language and that it was a northern greek dialect although greeks do not generally participate in the language versus dialect dispute they object to the use of the macedonian name in reference to the modern language calling it slavomacedonian or skopjan alphabet the macedonian alphabet as any slavic cyrillic alphabet is ultimately based on the cyrillic alphabet of saint cyril and saint methodius it is an adaptation of vuk karad i s phonetic alphabet which is the official alphabet of serbian language it is different from serbian cyrillic in letters and which have distinct phonetic value from their serbian counterparts while dze is unique in macedonian cyrillic common phrases classification and related languages the bosnian serbian croatian slovenian and bulgarian languages are related to macedonian but they are significantly different except for bulgarian which is mutually intelligible with some difficulties with macedonian they all compose the south slavic dialect continuum for the southern branch of the slavic languages the exact classification of the macedonian language is a political issue with serbia s standard language being based a good distance from macedonia s border the transitional language linking macedonian and bulgarian on the one hand with serbo croat and slovenian on the other is the torlakian which is spoken in northern macedonia and north western bulgaria and all over southern and eastern serbia republic of serbia is in fact roughly diagonally divided into two equal pieces from djerdap to metohija with the upper north western half speaking shtokavian and the lower south eastern half speaking torlakian dialects which southern branch is very similar to the literary macedonian the bulgarian linguists use to emphasise that a lexicological comparison between macedonian and bulgarian reveals that roughly one five of the whole vocabulary of both languages is different although most words usually exist in the other language with a different or slightly modified meaning six five of the words are only differently accented and two zero are identical lexical differences are owing to a great extent to loanwords borrowed by bulgarian from russian and by macedonian from serbian in the middle and the end of the two zero th century according to them compared to other languages the statistical differences between bulgarian and macedonian are similar to those between afrikaans and dutch on the other hand the fact is that the people of macedonia usually understand better the southern serbian dialects or literary serbian itself because of the cultural and historical links with serbia and they speak serbian more or less fluently due to historical reasons the modern slang of macedonian is usually identical with the serbian slang thus increasing the macedonian bulgarian differences nowadays after some decades of bulgarian and also serbian attempts to pronounce macedonian merely a dialect of their own language macedonian is now officially accepted as a language on its own that stands approximately right between bulgarian and serbian in features some specific features of the macedonian language the macedonian language shows some special and in some cases unique characteristics due to its central position in the balkans a very peculiar feature that has no parallel in other balkan languages is the existence of three definite articles pertaining to position of the object whereas bulgarian only has the basic unspecified form although other forms exist in bulgarian dialects another feature that sets macedonian apart from other slavic languages is the possibility to form the perfect tense with the verb to have and a neuter past passive participle as is common in germanic and romance languages in slavic languages that have perfect tenses these are almost universally built with the verb to be and a past active participle that is also an option in macedonian the older common slavic form with to be is predominant in the east of the country while the form with to have is more widespread in the west but has spread in the younger gernerations due to the influence of the standard language example new perfect old perfect i have caressed two other interesting features which however are shared with bulgarian are double object much more common in macedonian than in bulgarian and the mediative mood called renarrative mood in bulgarian linguistics and sometimes admirative in general linguistics see mood the mediative is a mood that designs the transmission of thoughts and enounciations which have been pronounced by another person but the locutor has heard them through rumors or gossip the l form is a mood for expression of the metaphoric category according to the french linguist claude hag ge an indigenous north american language central pomo possesses this category a phonetic characteristic of macedonian speech that sets it apart from the neighbouring languages is the permanent short stress falling on the syllable third from last and gradually moving along each time the word lengthens za mina vozot the train departed za mi nuvaj go from here imperative zami nu vanje departure zaminu va njeto the departure even so this tends not to be the case when the word has entered the language more recently and from a foreign source chiefly english menad ment management is pronounced me naj ment the use of the sound dz is also a unique characteristic of the macedonian language as compared with its neighbours the unique macedonian letter written as the latin s is associated to that sound neither bulgarian nor any other south slavic language possesses that characteristic letter and while the phoneme does occur in bulgarian it is restricted to foreign proper names and isn t considered a part of its standard phonemic inventory this phoneme has not been present in serbian alphabet either since the reforms of vuk karad i in the one nine th century although it is present in all the areas adjascent to macedonia torlakian dialects and as in bulgarian in foreign proper names the reason of dropping the letter from both serbian and bulgarian alphabets is the fact that the literary languages of those two nations deliberatery avoided the influence of torlakian or shop dialects where dz is frequently pronounced it is also present in serbian dialects from boka kotorska please compare the wikipedia or

element that readily forms ions cations and has metallic bonds and metals are sometimes described as a lattice of positive ions cations in a cloud of electrons the metals are one of the three groups of elements as distinguished by their ionisation and bonding properties along with the metalloids and nonmetals on the periodic table a diagonal line drawn from boron b to polonium po separates the metals from the nonmetals elements on this line are metalloids sometimes called semi metals elements to the lower left are metals elements to the upper right are nonmetals nonmetal elements are more abundant in nature than are metallic elements but metals in fact constitute most of the periodic table some well known metals are aluminium copper gold iron lead silver titanium uranium and zinc the allotropes of metals tend to be lustrous ductile malleable and good conductors while nonmetals generally speaking are brittle for solid nonmetals lack luster and are insulators a more modern definition of metals is that they have overlapping conductance and valence bands in their electronic structure this definition opens up the category for metallic polymers and other organic metals which have been made by researchers and employed in high tech devices these synthetic materials often have the characteristic silvery grey reflectiveness of elemental metals the properties of conductivity are mainly because each atom exerts only a loose hold on its outermost electrons valence electrons thus the valence electrons form a sort of sea around the close packed metal nucleii cations most metals are chemically unstable reacting with oxygen in the air to form oxides over varying timescales e g iron rusts over years potassium burns in seconds the alkali metals react quickest followed by the alkaline earth metals found in the leftmost two groups of the periodic table the transition metals take much longer to oxidise e g iron copper zinc nickel others like palladium platinum and gold do not react with the atmosphere at all some metals form a barrier layer of oxide on their surface which cannot be penetrated by further oxygen molecules and thus retain their shiny appearance and good conductivity for many decades e g aluminium some steels titanium painting or anodising metals are good ways to prevent their corrosion alloys an alloy is a mixture with metallic properties that contains at least one metal element examples of alloys are steel iron and carbon brass copper and zinc bronze copper and tin and duralumin aluminium and copper alloys specially designed for highly demanding applications such as jet engines may contain more than ten elements physical properties traditionally metals have certain characteristic physical properties they are usually shiny they have lustre have a high density are ductile and malleable usually have a high melting point are usually hard and conduct electricity and heat well however this is mainly because the low density soft low melting point metals happen to be reactive and we rarely encounter them in their elemental metallic form metals are also sonorous which means that they conduct sound well metal

proportion of automated e mail is transmitted via smtp in mime format internet e mail is so closely associated with the smtp and mime standards that it is sometimes called smtp mime e mail introduction the basic internet e mail transmission protocol smtp supports only seven bit ascii characters see also eight bitmime this effectively limits internet e mail to messages which when transmitted include only the characters sufficient for writing a small number of languages primarily english other languages based on the latin alphabet typically include diacritics not supported in seven bit ascii meaning text in these languages cannot be correctly represented in basic e mail mime defines mechanisms for sending other kinds of information in e mail including text in languages other than english using character encodings other than ascii as well as eight bit binary content such as files containing images sounds movies and computer programs mime is also a fundamental component of communication protocols such as http which requires that data be transmitted in the context of e mail like messages even though the data may not actually be e mail mapping messages into and out of mime format is typically done automatically by an e mail client or by mail servers when sending or receiving internet smtp mime e mail the basic format of internet e mail is defined in rfc two eight two two which is an updated version of rfc eight two two these standards specify the familiar formats for text e mail headers and body and rules pertaining to commonly used header fields such as to subject from and date mime defines a collection of e mail headers for specifying additional attributes of a message including content type and defines a set of transfer encodings which can be used to represent eight bit binary data using characters from the seven bit ascii character set mime also specifies rules for encoding non ascii characters in e mail message headers such as subject allowing these header fields to contain non english characters mime is extensible its definition includes a method to register new content types and other mime attribute values one of the explicit goals of the mime definition was to not require changes to pre existing e mail servers and to allow plain text e mail to function in both directions with pre existing clients this goal is achieved by allowing all mime message attributes to be optional with default values making a non mime message likely to be interpreted correctly by a mime capable client in addition a simple mime text message is likely to be interpreted correctly by a non mime client although it has e mail headers the non mime client won t know how to interpret mime headers mime version the presence of this header indicates the message is mime formatted the value is typically one zero so this header appears as mime version one zero content type this header indicates the type and subtype of the message content for example content type text plain the combination of type and subtype is generally called a mime type although in modern applications internet media type is the favored term indicating its applicability outside of mime messages a large number of file formats have registered mime types any text type has an additional charset parameter that can be included to indicate the character encoding a very large number of character encodings have registered mime charset names although originally defined for mime e mail the content type header and mime type registry is reused in other internet protocols such as http and sip the mime type registry is managed by iana through the use of the multipart type mime allows messages to have parts arranged in a tree structure where the leaf nodes are any non multipart content type and the non leaf nodes are any of a variety of multipart types this mechanism supports simple text messages using text plain the default value for content type text plus attachments multipart mixed with a text plain part and other non text parts a mime message including an attached file generally indicates the file s original name with the content disposition header so the type of file is indicated both by the mime content type and the usually os specific filename extension reply with original attached multipart mixed with a text plain part and the original message as a message rfc eight two two part alternative content such as a message sent in both plain text and another format such as html multipart alternative with the same content in text plain and text html forms many other message constructs content transfer encoding mime rfc two zero four five defines a set of methods for representing binary data in ascii text format the content transfer encoding mime header indicates the method that has been used the rfc and the iana s list of transfer encodings define the following values which are not case sensitive suitable for use with normal smtp seven bit up to nine nine eight octets per line of the code range one one two seven with cr and lf codes one zero and one three only allowed to appear as part of a crlf line ending this is the default value quoted printable used to encode arbitrary octet sequences into a form that satisfies the rules of seven bit designed to be efficient and mostly human readable when used for text data consisting primarily of us ascii characters but also containing byte values outside that range base six four used to encode arbitrary octet sequences into a form that satisfies the rules of seven bit has a fixed overhead and is intended for non text data and text that is not ascii heavy suitable for use with smtp servers that support the eight bitmime transport smtp extension eight bit up to nine nine eight octets per line cr and lf codes one zero and one three only allowed to appear as part of a crlf line ending not suitable for use with smtp binary any sequence of octets not usable with smtp mail there is no encoding defined which is explicitly designed for sending arbitrary binary data through eight bitmime transports thus base six four or quoted printable with their associated inefficiency must sometimes still be used encoded word since rfc two eight two two message header names and values are always ascii characters values that contain non ascii data must use the mime encoded word syntax rfc two zero four seven instead of a literal string this syntax uses a string of ascii characters indicating both the original character encoding the charset and the content transfer encoding used to map the bytes of the charset into ascii characters the form is charset encoding encoded text charset is often utf eight but may be any character set registered with iana iso two zero two two jp is common in japan iso eight eight five nine one and more recently iso eight eight five nine one five are common in western europe encoding can be either q denoting quoted printable encoding or b denoting base six four encoding encoded text is the quoted printable or base six four encoded text for example subject utf eight q c two a one hola two zero se c three b one or is interpreted as subject hola se or the encoded word format is not used for header names such as subject these header names are always in english in the raw message when viewing a message with a non english e mail client the header names are translated by the client multipart messages a mime multipart message contains a boundary in the content type header this boundary which must not occur in any of the parts is placed between the parts and at the beginning and end of the body of the message as follows content type multipart mixed boundary frontier mime version one zero frontier content type text plain

a multipart related has as its first part its main content all following items should have the mime header content id followed by some unique title often times a url is used as the content id the main part can then reference those items as inline a common technique is to have the main part an html document and use image tags to reference images stored in the latter parts multipart alternative the multipart alternative message is supposed to have the same or similar content in each part has a different content type header the mail client that displays the message then chooses which type is best to display most mail clients choose text html as the default spammers can take advantage of this and fill a text plain part of a multipart alternative message with words that make it sound like a legitimate e mail this is particularly good at fooling bayesian filtering spam filters multipart mixed multipart mixed is used for sending files with different content type headers inline or as attachments if sending pictures or other easily readable files most mail clients will display them inline unless otherwise specified with the content disposition header otherwise it will display them as attachments multipart report this is a message type that contains data formatted for a mail server to read it is split between a text plain or some other content type easily readable and a message delivery status which contains the data formatted for the mail server to read multipart signed a multipart signed message has two parts a body part and a signature part the whole of the body part including mime headers is used to create the signature part there are many signature types are possible like application pgp signature and application x pkcs seven signature multipart encrypted a

mehmet ii or muhammed ii also known as el fatih the conqueror in ottoman turkish or in modern turkish fatih sultan mehmet march three zero one four three two may three one four eight one arabic was first the sultan of the ottoman empire for a short time from one four four four to one four four six and later from one four five one to one four eight one he was also the first ottoman ruler to claim the title of caesar of the roman empire supreme ruler of all christians besides such usual titles as king sultan ruler of a muslim state khan ruler of turks etc he made this claim after his conquest of constantinople and assumption of that imperial regalia along with his own early reign mehmed was born in edirne then the capital city of the ottoman state on march three zero one four three two his father was sultan murad ii and his mother huma hatun was a daughter of abd allah of hum huma meaning a girl woman from hum when mehmed was one one years old he was sent to amasya to govern and thus gain experience as per the custom of ottoman rulers before his time after murad made peace with the karaman emirate in anatolia in august one four four four he resigned the throne to his one two year old son mehmed during his first reign mehmed asked his father murad to reclaim the throne in anticipation of the battle of varna but murad refused enraged at his father who had long since retired to a contemplative life in southwestern anatolia mehmed wrote if you are the sultan come and lead your armies if i am the sultan i hereby order you to come and lead my armies it was upon this letter that murad led the ottoman army in the battle of varna in one four four four it is said murad s return was forced by chandarli khalil pasha the grand vizier of the time who was not fond of mehmed s rule since mehmed s teacher was influential on him and did not like chandarli chandarli was later executed by mehmed during the siege of constantinople on the grounds that he had been bribed by or had somehow helped the defenders conquest of the byzantine empire two years after reclaiming the throne in one four five one mehmed brought an end to the byzantine empire by capturing its capital during the siege of constantinople after this conquest he conquered the despotate of morea in the peloponnese this last vestige of byzantine rule was absorbed by one four six one the conquest of constantinople bestowed immense glory and prestige on the country the ottoman state began to be recognized as an empire for the first time the historian steven runciman recounts that during the siege of constantinople mehmet promised his men the women and boys of the city upon its conquest he ordered the one four year old son of the grand duke lucas notaras be brought to him for his personal pleasure when the father refused to deliver his son to such a fate he had them both decapitated on the spot runciman the fall of constantinople one four five three cambridge university press one nine six five this story was originally recorded by doukas a byzantine greek living in constantinople at the time of the fall of the city and does not appear in accounts by other greeks who witnessed the conquest some modern scholars believe that the tale is merely one of a long series of attempts to portray muslims as morally inferior and point to the story of saint pelagius as its probable inspiration other explanations for this alleged departure from mehmet s nominal amnesty were that lucas notaras a treasury official had attempted to ingratiate himself with mehmet by retaining money from the byzantine treasury as a gift for the sultan mehmet was neither impressed nor grateful instead suggesting it should have been used for the defense of the city and viewed it as treason conquests in asia the conquest of constantinople allowed mehmed to turn his attention to anatolia mehmed tried to create a single political entity in anatolia by capturing turkish states called beyliks and the christian empire of trebizond in northeastern anatolia and allied himself with the golden horde in the crimea these conquests allowed him to push further into europe conquests in europe with anatolia secure and constantinople as his capital mehmed advanced into europe mehmed thought of himself as the heir to the throne of the roman empire which technically he was after capturing constantinople and as a result adopted the title kayser i r m roman caesar and invaded italy in one four eight zero the intent of his invasion was to capture rome and reunite the roman empire for the first time since seven five one and at first looked like he might be able to do it with the easy capture of otranto in one four eight zero however a rebellion led by a former janissary named skanderbeg in albania between one four four three and one four six eight and later in one four eight zero cut into his military links allowing a massive force led by pope sixtus iv to defeat and evict his army in one four eight one he led successful campaigns against small kingdoms in the balkans mehmed advanced toward eastern europe as far as belgrade and attempted to conquer the city from john hunyadi at the siege of belgrade in one four five six he also came into conflict with his former ally prince vlad iii dracula of wallachia in one four six two in one four seven five the ottomans suffered a defeat at the hands of stephen the great of moldavia at the battle of vaslui administrative actions mehmed amalgated the old byzantine adminsitration into the ottoman state as he gathered italian humanists and greek scholars at his court kept the byzantine church functioning ordered the patriarch to translate the christian faith into turkish and called gentile bellini from venice to paint his portrait he was extremely serious about his efforts to continue the roman empire with him as its caesar and came closer than most people realize to capturing rome and conquering italy he also tried to get muslim scientists and artists to his court in constantinople started a university built mosques waterways and the topkapi palace his reign is also well known for the tolerance with which he treated his subjects especially among the conquered byzantines which was very unusual for europe in the middle ages within the conquered city he established a millet or an autonomous religious community and he appointed the former patriarch as essentially governor of the city however his authority extended only unto the orthodox christians of the city and this excluded the genoese and venetian settlements in the suburbs and excluded the coming muslim and jewish settlers entirely this method allowed for an indirect rule of the christian byzantines and allowed the occupants to feel relatively autonomous even as mehmed began the turkish remodeling of the city eventually turning it into the turkish capital which it remained until the one nine two zero s other facts he is also recognized as the first sultan to codify criminal and constitutional law long before suleyman the magnificent also the lawmaker or kanuni and he thus established the classical image of the autocratic ottoman sultan padishah after the fall of constantinople he founded many universities and colleges in the city some of which are still active it is claimed that he spoke about seven languages when he was two one years old the age he conquered constantinople and early ottoman historians claimed that the prophet of islam praised him with the quote they will conquer kostantinaya hail to the prince and the army to whom that good fortune will be given babinger one nine seven eight p eight five his tomb is located at fatih mosque in istanbul the fatih sultan mehmet bridge is also named after him

slovak tennis players swiss tennis players australian open champions french open champions wimbledon champions us open champions mass is a property of a physical object that quantifies the amount of matter it contains unlike weight the mass of something stays the same regardless of location it is a central concept of classical mechanics and related subjects there are three different quantities called mass inertial mass is a measure of an object s resistance to changing its state of motion when a force is applied an object with small inertial mass changes its motion more readily and an object with large inertial mass does so less readily passive gravitational mass is a measure of the strength of an object s interaction with the gravitational field within the same gravitational field an object with a smaller passive gravitational mass experiences a smaller force than an object with a larger passive gravitational mass this force is called the weight of the object in informal usage the word weight is often used synonymously with mass because the strength of the gravitational field is roughly constant everywhere on the surface of the earth in physics the two terms are distinct an object will have a larger weight if it is placed in a stronger gravitational field but its passive gravitational mass remains unchanged active gravitational mass is a measure of the strength of the gravitational field due to a particular object for example the gravitational field that one experiences on the moon is weaker than that of the earth because the moon has less active gravitational mass introduction although inertial mass passive gravitational mass and active gravitational mass are conceptually distinct no experiment has ever unambiguously demonstrated any difference between them one of the consequences of the equivalence of inertial mass and passive gravitational mass is the fact famously demonstrated by galileo galilei that objects with different masses fall at the same rate assuming factors like air resistance are negligible the theory of general relativity the most accurate theory of gravitation known to physicists to date rests on the assumption that inertial and passive gravitational mass are completely equivalent this is known as the weak equivalence principle classically active and passive gravitational mass were equivalent as a consequence of newton s third law but a new axiom is required in the context of relativity s reformulation of gravity and mechanics thus standard general relativity also assumes the equivalence of inertial mass and active gravitational mass this equivalence is sometimes called the strong equivalence principle if one were to treat inertial mass m i passive gravitational mass m p and active gravitational mass m a distinctly newton s law of universal gravitation would give as force on the second mass due to the first mass m a two fracm newton s third law of reciprocal actions shows that active and passive mass are proportional as a result they can be defined to be equal units of mass in the si system of units mass is measured in kilograms kg many other units of mass are also employed such as grams g metric tons pounds ounces long and short tons quintals slugs atomic mass units planck masses solar masses and ev c two the ev c two unit is based on the electron volt ev which is normally used as a unit of energy however because of the relativistic connection between rest mass and energy e mc two see below it is possible to use any unit of energy as a unit of mass instead thus in particle physics where mass and energy are often interchanged it is common to use not only ev c two but even simply ev as a unit of mass roughly one seven eight three one zero three six kg because the gravitational acceleration is approximately constant on the surface of the earth a unit like the pound is often used to measure either mass or force e g weight although the pound is officially defined as a unit of force for more information on the different units of mass see orders of magnitude mass inertial mass inertial mass is the mass of an object measured by its resistance to acceleration to understand what the inertial mass of a body is one begins with classical mechanics and newton s laws of motion later on we will see how our classical definition of mass must be altered if we take into consideration the theory of special relativity which is more accurate than classical mechanics however the implications of special relativity will not change the meaning of mass in any essential way according to newton s second law we say that a body has a mass m if at any instant of time it obeys the equation of motion f frac mv where f is the force acting on the body and v is its velocity for the moment we will put aside the question of what force acting on the body actually means now suppose that the mass of the body in question is a constant this assumption known as the conservation of mass rests on the ideas that i mass is a measure of the amount of matter contained in a body and ii matter can never be created or destroyed only split up or recombined these are very reasonable assumptions for everyday objects though as we will see the situation gets more complicated when we take special relativity into account another point to note is that even in classical mechanics it is sometimes useful to treat the mass of an object as changing with time for example the mass of a rocket decreases as the rocket fires however this is an approximation based on ignoring pieces of matter which enter or leave the system in the case of the rocket these pieces correspond to the ejected propellant if we were to measure the total mass of the rocket and its propellant we would find that it is conserved when the mass of a body is constant newton s second law becomes f m frac m a where a denotes the acceleration of the body this equation illustrates how mass relates to the inertia of a body consider two objects with different masses if we apply an identical force to each the object with a bigger mass will experience a smaller acceleration and the object with a smaller mass will experience a bigger acceleration we might say that the larger mass exerts a greater resistance to changing its state of motion in response to the force however this notion of applying identical forces to different objects brings us back to the fact that we have not really defined what a force is we can sidestep this difficulty with the help of newton s third law which states that if one object exerts a force on a second object it will experience an equal and opposite force to be precise suppose we have two objects a and b with constant inertial masses ma and mb we isolate the two objects from all other physical influences so that the only forces present are the force exerted on a by b which we denote fab and the force exerted on b by a which we denote fba as we have seen newton s second law states that f m a a a and f m b a b where aa and ab are the accelerations of a and b respectively suppose that these accelerations are non zero so that the forces between the two objects are non zero this occurs for example if the two objects are in the process of colliding with one another newton s third law then states that f f substituting this into the previous equations we obtain m a frac m b note that our requirement that aa be non zero ensures that the fraction is well defined this is in principle how we would measure the inertial mass of an object we choose a reference object and define its mass mb as say one kilogram then we can measure the mass of every other object in the universe by colliding it with the reference object and measuring the accelerations gravitational mass gravitational mass is the mass of an object measured using the effect of a gravitational field on the object the concept of gravitational mass rests on newton s law of gravitation let us suppose we have two objects a and b separated by a distance r ab the law of gravitation states that if a and b have gravitational masses ma and mb respectively then each object exerts a gravitational force on the other of magnitude f two where g is the universal gravitational constant the above statement may be reformulated in the following way if g is the acceleration of a reference mass at a given location in a gravitational field then the gravitational force on an object with gravitational mass m is f mg this is the basis by which masses are determined by weighing in simple bathroom scales for example the force f is proportionate to the displacement of the spring beneath the weighing pan see hooke s law and the scales are calibrated to take g into account allowing the mass m to be read off note that a balance see the subheading within weighing scale as used in the laboratory or the health club measures mass only the spring scale measures weight equivalence of inertial and gravitational masses the equivalence of inertial and gravitational masses is sometimes referred to as the galilean equivalence principle or weak equivalence principle the most important consequence of this equivalence principle applies to freely falling objects suppose we have an object with inertial and gravitational masses m and m respectively if the only force acting on the object comes from a gravitational field g combining newton s second law and the gravitational law yields the acceleration k frac g this says that the ratio of gravitational to inertial mass of any object is equal to some constant k if and only if all objects fall at the same rate in a given gravitational field this phenomenon is referred to as the universality of free fall in addition the constant k can be taken to be one by defining our units appropriately the first experiments demonstrating the universality of free fall were conducted by galileo it is commonly stated that galileo obtained his results by dropping objects from the leaning tower of pisa but this is unlikely to be true actually he performed his experiments with balls rolling down inclined planes increasingly precise experiments have been performed such as those performed by lor nd e tv s using the torsion balance pendulum in one eight eight nine to date no deviation from universality and thus from galilean equivalence has ever been found more precise experimental efforts are still being carried out it should be noted that the universality of free fall only applies to systems in which gravity is the only force acting all other forces especially friction and air resistance must be absent or at least negligible for example if a hammer and a feather are dropped from the same height we all know that the feather will take much longer to reach the ground this happens because the feather is not really in free fall the force of air resistance on it is about as strong as the force of gravity on the other hand if the experiment is performed in a vacuum where there is no air resistance the hammer and the feather should fall at the same rate and reach the ground together this demonstration was in fact carried out in one nine seven one during the apollo one five moon walk by commander david scott a stronger version of the equivalence principle known as the einstein equivalence principle or the strong equivalence principle lies at the heart of the general theory of relativity einstein s equivalence principle states that it is impossible to distinguish between a uniform acceleration and a uniform gravitational field thus the theory postulates that inertial and gravitational masses are fundamentally the same thing all of the predictions of general relativity such as the curvature of spacetime are ultimately derived from this principle relativistic relation among mass energy and momentum special relativity is a necessary extension of classical physics in particular special relativity succeeds where classical mechanics fails badly in describing objects moving at speeds close to the speed of light in relativistic mechanics the mass m of a free particle is related to its energy e and momentum p by the equation frac m two c two p two where c is the speed of light this is sometimes referred to as the mass energy momentum relation the first thing to notice about this equation is that it can cope with massless objects m zero for which it reduces to e pc in classical mechanics massless objects are an ill defined concept since applying any force to one would produce via newton s second law an infinite acceleration a nonsensical result in relativistic mechanics they are objects that are always traveling at the speed of light an example being light itself in the form of photons the above equation says that the energy carried by a massless object is directly proportional to its momentum let us now consider objects with non zero mass for these the quantity m has a simple physical meaning it is the inertial mass of the object as measured in its rest frame the frame of reference in which its velocity is zero note massless objects do not possess a rest frame they are moving at the speed of light in any frame of reference the way we would measure m is exactly the same as in classical mechanics which we described above bouncing it off a reference object and measuring the accelerations as long as the velocity of each object remains much smaller than the speed of light during this procedure relativistic corrections to classical mechanics will be utterly negligible in the rest frame the velocity is zero and thus so is the momentum p the mass energy momentum relation thus reduces to e mc two which states that the energy of an object as measured in its rest frame its rest energy is equal to its mass times the square of the speed of light some books follow this up by stating that mass and energy are equivalent but this is somewhat misleading the mass of an object as we have defined it is a quantity intrinsic to the object and independent of our current frame of reference the energy e on the other hand varies with the frame of reference if the frame is moving at a high velocity relative to the object e will be very large simply because the object has a lot of kinetic energy in that frame thus e mc two is not a good relativistic statement it is true only in the rest frame of the object some authors define a quantity known as the relativistic mass which is basically the quantity e c two this makes the equivalence of mass and energy true by definition though neither quantity is frame independent relativistic mass was used in many early writings on relativity and it is still used in books for laymen as well as introductory physics classes however the concept is downplayed or discouraged by many physicists nowadays for reasons explained in the article on mass in special relativity following the modern usage whenever we refer to mass in this article we always mean the rest mass unless otherwise identified having defined the mass of an object let us look at how it behaves when not at rest we can arrange the mass energy momentum relation in the following way e mc two sqrt right two when the momentum p is much smaller than mc we can taylor expand the square root with the result e mc two cdots the leading term which is the largest is of course the rest energy the object always has this minimum amount of energy regardless of its momentum the second term is the classical expression for the kinetic energy of the particle and the higher order terms are basically relativistic corrections for the kinetic energy for a macroscopic object the rest energy mc two includes the thermal energy which depends on the temperature of the object and is related to the random motion of the atoms or molecules of which the object is composed this contribution is usually much smaller than the total rest energy but often bigger than the kinetic energy for example if two objects stick together after a collision between them the total kinetic energy of the objects is not conserved and a significant part of it is transformed into thermal energy so their mass increases by a tiny amount similarly metabolism fire and other exothermic chemical processes convert mass to energy however the mass change is usually negligible more significant changes of the rest energy occur in processes that split or combine subatomic particles the reason is that mass as we have defined it is not conserved during such processes the simplest example is the process of electron positron annihilation in which an electron and a positron annihilate each other to produce a pair of photons the electron and positron both have non zero mass but the photons are massless other examples include nuclear fusion and nuclear fission energy unlike mass is always conserved in special relativity so roughly speaking what is happening in these reactions is that the rest energy of the reactants is being transformed into the kinetic energy of the reaction products the fact that rest energy can be liberated in this way is one of the most important

forms of the words markka and penni are markkaa and penni history one markka banknote from one eight six zero the markka was introduced in one eight six zero as a quarter of the russian ruble in one eight six five the markka was separated from the russian ruble and tied to the value of silver after finland gained independence in one nine one seven the bank of finland was founded and the markka was reintroduced as an independent currency backed by gold the gold standard was abolished in one nine four zero and the markka suffered heavy inflation during the war years in one nine six three the markka was replaced by the new markka equivalent to one zero zero old units the name markka was based on a medieval unit of weight both markka and penni are loanwords based on the same roots as the german mark and pfennig although the word markka predates the currency by several centuries the currency was established before being named markka a competition was held for its name and some of the other entries included sataikko meaning having a hundred parts omena apple and suomo from suomi the finnish name for finland during the history of the finnish markka spanning over one four zero years

by the euro manganese is a chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol mn and atomic number two five notable characteristics manganese is a gray white metal resembling iron it is a hard metal and is very brittle fusible with difficulty but easily oxidized manganese metal is ferromagnetic only after special treatment the most common oxidation states of manganese are two three four six and seven though oxidation states from one to seven are observed mn two often competes with mg two in biological systems and manganese compounds where manganese is in oxidation state seven are powerful oxidizing agents applications manganite a manganese oxide manganese is essential to iron and steel production by virtue of its sulfur fixing deoxidizing and alloying properties steelmaking including its ironmaking component has accounted for most manganese demand presently in the range of eight five to nine zero of the total demand among a variety of other uses manganese is a key component of low cost stainless steel formulations and certain widely used aluminium alloys it is also added to gasoline in order to reduce engine knocking manganese iv oxide manganese dioxide is used in the original type of dry cell battery manganese dioxide is also used as a catalyst manganese is used to decolorize glass removing the greenish tinge that presence of iron produces and in higher concentration make violet colored glass manganese oxide is a brown pigment that can be used to make paint and is a component of natural umber potassium permanganate is a potent oxidizer and used in chemistry and in medicine as a disinfectant manganese phosphating is used for rust and corrosion preventation on steel it is very occasionally used in coins the only united states coins to use manganese were the wartime nickel from one nine four two one nine four five and the sacagawea dollar two zero zero zero present the overall level and nature of manganese use in the united states is expected to remain about the same in the near term no practical technologies exist for replacing manganese with other materials or for using domestic deposits or other accumulations to reduce the complete dependence of the united states on other countries for manganese ore substitutes manganese has no satisfactory substitute in its major applications in minor applications e g manganese phosphating zinc and sometimes vanadium are viable substitutes history manganese latin magnes meaning magnet was in use in prehistoric times paints that were pigmented with manganese dioxide can be traced back one seven zero zero zero years the egyptians and romans used manganese compounds in glass making to either remove color from glass or add color to it manganese can be found in the iron ores used by the spartans some speculate that the exceptional hardness of spartan steels derives from the inadvertent production of an iron manganese alloy in the one seven th century german chemist johann glauber first produced permanganate a useful laboratory reagent although some people believe that it was discovered by ignites kaim in one seven seven zero by the mid one eight th century manganese dioxide was in use in the manufacture of chlorine the swedish chemist scheele was the first to recognize that manganese was an element and his colleague johan gottlieb gahn isolated the pure element in one seven seven four by reduction of the dioxide with carbon around the beginning of the one nine th century scientists began exploring the use of manganese in steelmaking with patents being granted for its use at the time in one eight one six it was noted that adding manganese to iron made it harder without making it any more brittle in one eight three seven british academic couper noted an association between heavy exposure to manganese in mines with a form of parkinson s disease in one nine one two manganese phosphating electrochemical conversion coatings for protecting firearms against rust and corrosion were patented in the united states and have seen widespread use ever since biological role manganese is an essential trace nutrient in all forms of life the classes of enzymes that have manganese cofactors are very broad and include such classes as oxidoreductases transferases hydrolases lyases isomerases ligases lectins and integrins the best known manganese containing polypeptides may be arginase mn containing superoxide dismutase and the diphtheria toxin occurrence manganese ore manganese occurs principally as pyrolusite mno two and to a lesser extent as rhodochrosite mnco three land based resources are large but irregularly distributed those of the united states are very low grade and have potentially high extraction costs south africa and ukraine

quantities of manganese exist in manganese nodules on the ocean floor attempts to find economically viable methods of harvesting manganese nodules were abandoned in the one nine seven zero s compounds potassium permanganate also called condy s crystals is a commonly used laboratory reagent because of its oxidizing properties and finds use as a topical medicine for example in the treatment of fish diseases manganese iv oxide manganese dioxide is used in dry cells and can be used to decolorize glass that is polluted by trace amounts of iron manganese compounds can color glass an amethyst color and are responsible for the color of true amethyst manganese dioxide is also used in the manufacture of oxygen and chlorine and in drying black paints the most stable oxidation state for manganese is two and many manganese ii compounds are known such as manganese ii sulfate mnso four and manganese ii chloride mncl two this oxidation state is also seen in the mineral rhodochrosite manganese ii carbonate the three oxidation state is also known in compounds such as manganese iii acetate but these are quite powerful oxidising agents isotopes naturally occurring manganese is composed of one stable isotope five five mn one eight radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being five three mn with a half life of three seven million years five four mn with a half life of three one two three days and five two mn with a half life of five five nine one days all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives that are less than three hours and the majority of these have half lives that are less than one minute this element also has three meta states manganese is part of the iron group of elements which are thought to be synthesized in large stars shortly before supernova explosion manganese five three decays to five three cr with a half life of three seven million years because of its relatively short half life five three mn is an extinct radionuclide manganese isotopic contents are typically combined with chromium isotopic contents and have found application in isotope geology and radiometric dating mn cr isotopic ratios reinforce the evidence from two six al and one zero seven pd for the early history of the solar system variations in five three cr five two cr and mn cr ratios from several meteorites indicate an initial five three mn five five mn ratio that suggests mn cr isotopic systematics must result from in situ decay of five three mn in differentiated planetary bodies hence five three mn provides additional evidence for nucleosynthetic processes immediately before coalescence of the solar system the isotopes of manganese range in atomic weight from four six amu four six mn to six five amu six five mn the primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope five five mn is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta decay precautions manganese in excess is toxic exposure to manganese dusts and fumes should not exceed the ceiling value of five mg m three for even short periods because of its toxicity level acidic permanganate solutions will oxidize any organic material they come into contact with the oxidation process can generate enough heat to ignite some organic substances in two zero zero five a study suggested a possible link between manganese inhalation and central nervous system toxicity in rats it is hypothesized that long term exposure to the naturally occurring manganese in shower water puts up to eight seven million americans at risk a form of parkinson s disease type

is mo and its atomic number four two notable characteristics molybdenum is a transition metal the pure metal is silvery white in color and very hard and has one of the highest melting points of all pure elements in small quantities molybdenum is effective at hardening steel molybdenum is important in plant nutrition and is found in certain enzymes including xanthine oxidase molybdenum prices have increased from a low of about two pound in two zero zero zero to about four zero pound in two zero zero five applications over two three of all molybdenum is used in alloys molybdenum use soared during world war i when demand for tungsten wolfram made tungsten scarce and high strength steels were at a premium molybdenum is used to this day in high strength alloys and in high temperature steels special molybdenum containing alloys such as the hastelloys are notably heat resistant and corrosion resistant molybdenum is used in oil pipelines aircraft and missile parts and in filaments molybdenum finds use as a catalyst in the petroleum industry especially in catalysts for removing organic sulfurs from petroleum products mo nine nine is used in the nuclear isotope industry molybdenum oranges are pigments ranging from red yellow to a bright red orange and used in paints inks plastics and rubber compounds molybdenum disulfide is a good lubricant especially at high temperatures molybdenum is also used in some electronic applications as the conductive metal layers in thin film transistors tfts history molybdenum from the greek molybdos meaning lead like is not found free in nature and the compounds that can be found were until the late one eight th century confused with compounds of other elements such as carbon or lead in one seven seven eight carl wilhelm scheele was able to determine that molybdenum was separate from graphite and lead and isolated the oxide of the metal from molybdenite in one seven eight two hjelm isolated an impure extract of the metal by reducing the oxide with carbon molybdenum was little used and remained in the laboratory until the late one nine th century subsequently a french company schneider and co tried molybdenum as an alloying agent in steel armor plate and noted its useful properties occurrence though molybdenum is found in such minerals as wulfenite pbmoo four or powellite camoo four the main commercial source of molybdenum is molybdenite mos two molybdenum is mined directly and is also recovered as a byproduct of copper mining molybdenum is present in ores from zero zero one to about zero five about half of the world s molybdenum is mined in the united states with phelps dodge corporation being a primary provider the russian luna two four mission discovered a single grain one x zero six m of pure molybdenum in a pyroxene fragment taken from mare crisium on the moon biological role molybdenum has been found to have a role in the biology of all classes of organisms it is found in two groups of enzymes the nitrogenases and the molybdopterins the nitrogenases are found in bacteria and are involved in the pathways of nitrogen fixation the bacteria may be found inside plants the molybdenum atom is present in a cluster see cluster chemistry which includes iron and sulfur atoms the name molybdopterin is misleading as the group of enzymes includes tungsten containing enzymes and the word molybdopterin does not actually refer to the metal atom the group may also be referred to as the mononuclear molybdenum enzymes as the metal atom is not present in a cluster this group of enzymes are involved in a variety of processes as part of the global sulfur nitrogen and carbon cycles and generally involve an oxygen atom transfer as part of the process there is a trace requirement for molybdenum in plants and soils can be barren due to molybdenum deficiencies plants and animals generally have molybdenum present in amounts of a few parts per million in animals molybdenum is a cofactor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase which is involved in the pathways of purine degradation and formation of uric acid in some animals adding a small amount of dietary molybdenum enhances growth francis crick suggested that since molybdenum is an essential trace element that plays an important role in many enzymatic reactions despite being less abundant than the more common elements such as chromium and nickel that perhaps this fact is indictative of panspermia crick theorized that if it could be shown that the elements represented in terrestrial living organisms corelate closely with those that are abundant in some class of star molybdenum stars for example that this would provide evidence of such directed panspermia isotopes molybdenum has six stable isotopes and almost two dozen radioisotopes the vast majority of which have half lives measured in seconds mo nine nine is used in sorpation generators to create tc nine nine for the nuclear isotope industry the market for mo nine nine products is estimated to be on the order of us one zero zero million per year precautions molybdenum dusts and molybdenum compounds such as molybdenum trioxide and water soluble molybdates may have slight toxicities if inhaled or ingested orally laboratory tests suggest compared to many heavy metals that molybdenum is of relatively low toxicity acute toxicity in humans is unlikely because the dose required would be exceptionally large there is the potential for molybdenum exposure in mining and refining operations as well as the chemical industry but to date no instance of harm from this exposure has been reported though water soluble molybdenum compounds can have a slight toxicity those that are insoluble such as the lubricant molybdenum disulfide are considered to be non toxic however environmental chains of events can end in serious molybdenum related health consequences in one nine nine six an increase in acid rain near uppsala sweden caused a depletion in the natural foods of moose in nearby rural areas this caused the moose to venture into the fields of oat farmers who had been heavily liming their soil to compensate for the effect of the acid the lime caused changes to the levels of cadmium and other trace metals in the soil causing the oat crops to uptake trace molybdenum in large quantities ingestion of the oats by hundreds of moose brought on a severe disturbance in the ratio of molybdenum to copper in their livers which caused emaciation hair discoloration ulcers diarrhea convulsions blindness osteoporosis and finally heart failure osha regulations specify maximum molybdenum exposure in an eight hour day four zero hour week to be one five milligrams per cubic meter niosh recommends exposure limit of five zero zero zero mg per cubic meter toxicity in animals in ruminants the molybdenum toxicity occurs if the animals are let to graze on soil rich in molybdenum but deficient in copper the molybdenum causes excretion of copper reserves from the animal and cause copper deficiency in young calves the molybdenum toxicity is manifested as teart or shooting diarrhoea where the dung is watery full of air bubbles and with a fetid odor in pig and sheep molybdenum toxicity combined with copper deficiency can lead to a condition called sway back or paralysis of hind quarters in black coated animals the toxicity of this metal is characterized by depigmentation of the skin surrounding the eyes which is often referred to as spectacled eyes references los alamos national laboratory molybdenum external links webelements com

for the band see mineral band minerals are natural compounds formed through geological processes the term mineral encompasses not only the material s chemical composition but also the mineral s structure minerals range in composition from pure elements and simple salts to very complex silicates with thousands of known forms organic compounds are usually excluded the study of minerals is called mineralogy an assortment of minerals photo from us geological survey mineral definition and classification to be classified as a true mineral a substance must be a solid and have a crystal structure it must also be an inorganic naturally occurring homogeneous substance with a defined chemical composition the chemical composition may vary between end members of a mineral system for example the plagioclase feldspars comprise a continuous series from sodium rich albite naalsi three o eight to calcium rich anorthite caal two si two o eight with four recognized intermediate compositions between mineral like substances that don t strictly meet the definition are sometimes classified as mineraloids other natural occurring substances are nonminerals industrial minerals is a commercial term and refers to commercially valuable mined materials see also minerals and rocks section below a crystal structure is the orderly geometric spatial arrangement of atoms in the internal structure of a mineral there are one four basic crystal lattice arrangements of atoms in three dimensions in the six crystal systems and all crystal structures currently recognized fit in one of these one four arrangements this crystal structure is based on regular internal atomic or ionic arrangement that is often visible as the mineral form even when the mineral grains are too small to see or are irregularly shaped the crystal structure can be determined by x ray analysis and or optical microscopy chemistry and crystal structure define together a mineral in fact two or more minerals may have the same chemical composition but differ in crystal structure these are known as polymorphs for example pyrite and marcasite are both iron sulfide similarly some minerals have different chemical compositions but the same crystal structure for example halite made from sodium and chlorine galena made from lead and sulfur and periclase made from magnesium and oxygen all share the same cubic crystal structure crystal structure greatly influences a mineral s physical properties for example though diamond and graphite have the same composition both are pure carbon graphite is very soft while diamond is the hardest of all known minerals there are currently just over four zero zero zero known minerals according to the international mineralogical association which is responsible for the approval of and naming of new mineral species found in nature minerals and rocks a mineral is a naturally occurring inorganic solid with a definite chemical composition and a crystalline structure a rock is an aggregate of one or more minerals a rock may also include organic remains the specific minerals in a rock can vary a lot some minerals like quartz mica or feldspar are common while others have been found in only one or two locations worldwide over half of the mineral species known are so rare that they have only been found in a handful of samples and many are known from only one or two small grains commercially valuable minerals and rocks are refered to as industrial minerals physical properties of minerals classifying minerals can range from simple to very difficult a mineral can be identified by several physical properties some of them being sufficient for full identification without equivocation in other cases minerals can only be classified by more complex chemical or x ray diffraction analysis these methods however can be costly time consuming and even risk damaging the sample physical properties commonly used are crystal structure and habit see the above discussion of crystal structure a mineral may show good crystal habit or form or it may be massive granular or compact with only microscopically visible crystals hardness the physical hardness of a mineral is usually measured according to the mohs scale of mineral hardness luster indicates the way a mineral s surface interacts with light and can range from dull to glassy vitreous color indicates the appearance of the mineral in reflected light or transmitted light for translucent minerals i e what it looks like to the naked eye streak refers to the color of the powder a mineral leaves after rubbing it on an unglazed porcelain streak plate cleavage describes the way a mineral may come apart or cleave in different ways in thin section cleavage is visible as thin parallel lines across a mineral fracture describes how a mineral breaks when broken contrary to its natural cleavage planes specific gravity relates the mineral mass to the mass of an equal volume of water namely the density of the material other properties fluorescence response to ultraviolet light magnetism radioactivity tenacity response to mechanical induced changes of shape or form and reactivity to dilute acids chemical properties of minerals minerals may be classified according to chemical composition they are here categorized by anion group the list below is in approximate order of their abundance in the earth s crust the list follows the dana classification system silicate class the largest group of minerals by far are the silicates which are composed largely of silicon and oxygen with the addition of ions such as aluminium magnesium iron and calcium some important rock forming silicates include the feldspars quartz olivines pyroxenes amphiboles garnets and micas carbonate class the carbonate minerals consist of those minerals containing the anion co three two and include calcite and aragonite both calcium carbonate dolomite magnesium calcium carbonate and siderite iron carbonate carbonates are commonly deposited in marine settings when the shells of dead planktonic life settle and accumulate on the sea floor carbonates are also found in evaporitic settings e g the great salt lake utah and also in karst regions where the dissolution and reprecipitation of carbonates leads to the formation of caves stalactites and stalagmites the carbonate class also includes the nitrate and borate minerals sulfate class sulfates all contain the sulfate anion in the form so four two sulfates commonly form in evaporitic settings where highly saline waters slowly evaporate allowing the formation of both sulfates and halides at the water sediment interface sulfates also occur in hydrothermal vein systems as gangue minerals along with sulfide ore minerals another occurrence is as secondary oxidation products of original sulfide minerals common sulfates include anhydrite calcium sulfate celestite strontium sulfate barite barium sulfate and gypsum hydrated calcium sulfate the sulfate class also includes the chromate molybdate selenate sulfite tellurate and tungstate minerals halide class the halides are the group of minerals forming the natural salts and include fluorite calcium fluoride halite sodium chloride sylvite potassium chloride and sal ammoniac ammonium chloride halides like sulfates are commonly found in evaporitic settings such as playa lakes and landlocked seas such as the dead sea and great salt lake the halide class includes the fluoride chloride and iodide minerals oxide class oxides are extremely important in mining as they form many of the ores from which valuable metals can be extracted they commonly occur as precipitates close to the earth s surface oxidation products of other minerals in the near surface weathering zone and as accessory minerals in igneous rocks of the crust and mantle common oxides include hematite iron oxide magnetite iron oxide chromite chromium oxide spinel magnesium aluminium oxide a common component of the mantle rutile titanium dioxide and ice hydrogen oxide the oxide class includes the oxide and the hydroxide minerals sulfide class many sulfides are economically important as metal ores common sulfides include pyrite iron sulfide commonly known as fools gold chalcopyrite copper iron sulfide and galena lead sulfide the sulfide class also includes the selenides the tellurides the arsenides the antimonides the bismuthinides and the sulfosalts sulfur and a second anion such as arsenic phosphate class the phosphate mineral group actually includes any mineral with a tetrahedral unit ao four where a can be phosphorus antimony arsenic or vanadium by far the most common phosphate is apatite which is an important biological mineral found in teeth and bones of many animals the phosphate class includes the phosphate arsenate vanadate and antimonate minerals element class the elemental group includes metals and intermetallic elements gold silver copper semi metals and non metals antimony

to make reconstituted or cultured marble places named after the stone include marble hill manhattan new york the sea of marmara india s marble rocks and the towns of marble minnesota marble colorado and marble arch london the elgin marbles are marble sculptures from the parthenon that are on display in the british museum they were brought to britain by the earl of elgin marble origins marble is a metamorphic rock resulting from regional or at times contact metamorphism of sedimentary carbonate rocks either limestone or dolostone this metamorphic process causes a complete recrystallization of the original rock into an interlocking mosaic of calcite and or dolomite crystals the temperatures and pressures necessary to form marble usually destroy any fossils and sedimentary textures present in the original rock pure white marble is the result of metamorphism of very pure limestones the characteristic swirls and veins of many colored marble varieties are usually due to various mineral impurities such as clay silt sand iron oxides or chert which were originally present as grains or layers in the limestone green coloration is often due to serpentine resulting from originally high magnesium limestone or dolostone with silica impurities these various impurities have been mobilized and recrystallized by the intense pressure and heat of the metamorphism kinds of marble natural patterns on the polished surface of landscape marble can resemble a city skyline or even trees blocks of cut marble at the historic quarry in marble colorado some historically important kinds of marble named after the locations of their quarries include paros from greece penteli from greece carrara from italy proconnesus from turkey macael from spain danby from vermont white marbles like carrara have been prized for sculpture since classical times this preference has to do with the softness and relative isotropy and homogeneity and a relative resistance to shattering also the low index of refraction of calcite allows light to penetrate several millimeters into the stone before being scattered out resulting in the characteristic waxy look which gives life to marble sculptures of the human body construction marble in the construction trade the term marble is used for any massive crystalline calcitic rock and some non calcitic rocks useful as building stone for example

in the city center this is munich s central cathedral and is famous for the brass onion domes that top the twin towers the domes were added in the one six th century not matching the gothic style of the building and thus giving it a somewhat peculiar style mix the original design asked for pointed towers like the dome of cologne but those where never built for lack of money at first glance the two towers appear to be the same height but in actual fact one is slightly taller than the other unlike most buildings in munich s old town the towers of the frauenkirche but not the church itself survived the war intact making them more than five zero zero years old the frauenkirche s towers nine nine meters or three two five feet are also the measurement for a new rule which limits the height of new buildings to the same height in the city this rule was passed in november two zero zero four by the people of munich in a referendum organized by georg kronawitter a former spd mayor against

refers to the cloaca are mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young like marsupials metatheria and placental mammals eutheria the subclass comprises a single order monotremata though sometimes the subclass prototheria is used general characteristics like other mammals monotremes are warm blooded with high metabolic rates though not as high as other mammals see below have hair on their bodies produce milk to feed their young have a single bone in their lower jaw and have three middle ear bones though this feature is now thought to have evolved independently in monotremes see below monotremes were very poorly understood for many years and to this day some of the one nine th century myths that grew up around them endure it is still sometimes thought for example that the monotremes are inferior or quasi reptilian and that they are a distant ancestor of the superior placental mammals it now seems plain that modern monotremes are the survivors of an early branching of the mammal tree a later branching is thought to have led to the marsupial and placental groups similarly it is still sometimes said that monotremes have less developed internal temperature control mechanisms than other mammals but more recent research shows that monotremes maintain a constant body temperature in a wide variety of circumstances without difficulty such as the platypus which can maintain its body temperature even while living in an icy mountain stream early researchers were misled by two factors monotremes maintain a lower average temperature than most mammals around nine zero f three two c compared to about nine five f three five c for marsupials and one zero zero f three eight c for most placentals secondly the short beaked echidna which is much easier to study than the reclusive platypus only maintains normal temperature when it is active during cold weather it conserves energy by switching off its temperature regulation platypus physiology the key physiological difference between monotremes and other mammals is the one that gave them their name monotreme means single opening in greek and comes from the fact that their urinary defecatory and reproductive systems all open into a single duct the cloaca this structure is very similar to the one found in reptiles in contrast to the single cloaca of monotremes other mammal females have separate openings for reproduction urination and defecation the vagina the urethra and the anus monotremes lay eggs however the egg is retained for some time within the mother who actively provides the egg with nutrients monotremes also lactate but have no defined nipples excreting the milk via their skin all species are long lived with low rates of reproduction and relatively prolonged parental care of infants living monotremes lack teeth as adults fossil forms and modern platypus young have the tribosphenic three cusped molars which are one of the hallmarks of mammals however recent work suggests that monotremes acquired this form of molar independently of placental mammals and marsupials luo et al two zero zero one the jaw of monotremes is constructed somewhat differently from that of other mammals and the jaw opening muscle is different as in all true mammals the tiny bones that conduct sound to the inner ear are fully incorporated into the skull rather than lying in the jaw as in cynodonts and other pre mammalian synapsids however this feature too is now claimed to have evolved independently in monotremes and therians rich et al two zero zero five however the external opening of the ear still lies at the base of the jaw the monotremes also have extra bones in the shoulder girdle including an interclavicle which are not found in other mammals monotremes retain a reptile like gait with legs that are on the sides of rather than underneath the body the monotreme leg bears a spur in the ankle region the spur is non functional in echidnas but contains a powerful venom in the male platypus their metabolic rate is remarkably low by mammalian standards although the extent to which this is a characteristic of monotremes as opposed to an adaptation on the part of the small number of surviving species to harsh environmental conditions is uncertain taxonomy the only surviving examples of monotremes are all indigenous to australia and new guinea although there is evidence that they were once more widespread fossils of a jaw fragment one one zero million years old were found at lightning ridge new south wales these fragments from species steropodon galmani are the oldest known fossils of monotremes fossils from the genera kollikodon teinolophos and obdurodon have also been discovered in one nine nine one a fossil tooth of a six one million year old platypus was

countries in southeastern europe for other uses see macedonia macedonia is a geographical and historical region of the balkan peninsula in south eastern europe whose area was re defined in the early two zero th century it covers about six seven zero zero zero square kilometres and a population of four seven six million the territory corresponds to the basins of from west to east the ali kmon vardar axios and struma strymon rivers of which the axios vardar drains by far the largest area and the plains around thessaloniki and serres the region is divided between four countries greece with more than half the area and population split between the three peripheries of central macedonia west macedonia and east macedonia and thrace the republic of macedonia with around four zero bulgaria with less than a tenth in blagoevgrad province and albania with around one five around lake ohrida etymology of the name of macedonia according to ancient greek mythology macedon ancient greek maked n poetic mak d n was the name of the first phylarch tribal chief of the maked nes the part of the makedno tribe which initially settled western southern and central macedonia and founded the kingdom of macedon ccording to herodotus histories eight four seven the makedno were in turn a tribe of the dorians all these names are probably derived from the doric adjective makedn s attic m kedan s meaning tall this in turn is derived from the doric noun m kos attic and modern greek m kros and m kos meaning length both the macedonians maked nes and their makedno tribal ancestors were regarded as tall people and they are likely to have received their name on account of their height see also list of traditional greek place names homer uses the genitive makedn s to describe a tall poplar tree and others weave webs or as they sit twirl the yarn like unto the leaves of a tall poplar tree of the female slaves of the phaeacians od seven one zero five f it has been suggested that the name maked nes may mean highlanders from a hypothetical i e unattested macedonian bahuvrihi maki ked nes of the high earth with the first constituent maki allegedly meaning high and an unattested second part ked n being cognate to attic khth n earth however the word has only been used to describe tall physical stature in humans and only in two instances has it been used to mean height of inanimate objects the aforementioned homeric tall poplar tree and the imaginary wall built around the city of the birds in the comedy by the same name by aristophanes furthermore if the word makiked n actually ever existed it should be paroxytone as in etc not oxytone boundaries and definitions the name of macedonia has not been always used with regard to the region as defined above in its beginnings the ancient state of macedon encompassed only a part of this region approximately equal to the present day greek macedonia but also including parts of the republic of macedonia as well macedonian province of roman empire the majority of the roman province of macedonia consisted of what is today northern greece but also included the present day geographical region of macedonia and albania due to macedonian expansion the roman province of macedonia covered a much larger area than the original state of macedon according to h r wilkinson author of maps and politics a review of the ethnographic cartography of macedonia macedonia defies definition for a number of reasons hardly two authorities can be found to agree on its exact delineation although many agree on its general location the name itself is the latin form of an ancient greek place name one of many which has persisted right down to our own day for describing this part of europe this persistence has largely been due to the effect of the turkish conquest ignorance of balkan languages difficulties of transliteration lack of topographical survey all combined to restrict the use of contemporary place names so that the opening of the one nine th century still found western european scholars thinking of balkan geography in terms of ptolemy and strabo macedonia to them meant the roman province framed by a natural boundary of mountains marching with geometrical precision on all sides the pindus the scardus the rhodope these somewhat oversimplified interpretations may be the root cause of the modern tendency to define macedonia as a natural region a tendency apparent in the works of bulgarian british american french italian and german geographers wilkinson also identifies problems with defining it as a single geographical area the use of the name natural boundaries and natural region in connection with these definitions is highly misleading in view of the diversity of structure relief and climate found within the prescribed region as well as the debatable nature of the so called limits on examination of a detailed orographical map the natural framework is found to consist of complicated systems of mountain ranges which achieve only here and there a lineal form and within which prevails a diversity of land forms and a complex drainage system of all teh attempts to define macedonia that which makes its appeal to physical geography is the least profitable and also the easiest to refute the difficulty also affects the identification of a historical continuity of boundaries perhaps equally facile are the attempts to define macedonia historically by invoking its past political boundaries historians less concerned with the propagandist value of their researches have revealed the traditional ephemeral character of macedonian political boundaries from being reduced to the confines of salonika at certain periods of its classical history macedonia has at other times reached the adriatic the haemus and the danube no useful purpose therefore is achieved by insisting on the hypothetical stability of the historical boundaries of macedonia the osmanli turks who inherited so much from their byzantine precursors never recognized any macedonian administrative unit it is not unreasonable to conclude that history no more sets its seal upon the boundaries of macedonia than does physical geography in the byzantine empire there was a number of different themas provinces dividing the geographical region of macedonia a thema under the name of macedonia was carved out of the original thema of thrace well to the east of the struma river during the middle ages this thema variously included parts of eastern rumelia and western thrace within its shifting boundaries and gave its name to the macedonian dynasty under emperor basil i the region of macedonia ruled by the first bulgarian empire throughout the nine th and the one zero th century was incorporated into the byzantine empire in one zero one eight as the thema of bulgaria with the conquest of the region by the ottomans in the late one four th century and its incorporation into the ottoman rumili province the name macedonia as an administrative designation disappeared for several centuries and was rarely displayed on maps the name was again revived in the one nine th century by european cartographers to mean a distinct geographical region with roughly the same borders as today demographics distribution of races in the balkan peninsula and asia minor in one nine one zero historical atlas by william r shepherd new york as a frontier region where several very different cultures meet macedonia has an extremely diverse demographic profile today greeks form the majority of its population living almost entirely in greece the second largest group of people in the region are the macedonians a slavic people who form the majority of the population in the republic of macedonia also there is a small three zero zero zero strong macedonian minority in the bulgarian region of blagoevgrad which is otherwise known as pirin macedonia the number of macedonians in greek macedonia is disputed as greece s censuses have not included the criteria of ethnicity and mother tongue since the one nine five zero s however human rights watch released a report in one nine nine four estimating one zero zero zero zero zero two zero zero zero zero zero people of macedonian decent in the region it is important to note that the identity of the macedonians is a hotly disputed question in the region most greeks oppose their use of the term macedonians and bulgarians and greeks alike consider them to be a subset of another people the bulgarians this issue is further discussed in the article regarding macedonians ethnic group the other two major ethnic groups in the region are the bulgarians who represent the majority of the population of pirin macedonia and the albanians who are the majority inhabitants of the western and southwestern parts of the republic of macedonia albanians represent approximatlly two five of the population in the reupblic of macedonia from cia world factbook smaller numbers of turks bosniaks roma serbs and vlachs may also be found in macedonia most of the inhabitants of the regions are christians of the eastern orthodox rite principally the bulgarian orthodox the greek orthodox and the serbian orthodox churches as well as the unrecognized macedonian orthodox church there is however a substantial muslim minority principally among the albanians pomaks muslim bulgarians bosniaks and turks history a general view the two zero th century was an infinite struggle for the balkan states to expand their territory sfetas believes that the nation state as a political entity is a creation of the one nine th century however the elements of which the nation consists must already exist language tradition historical memories historical area defined even by arbitrary criteria national myths but on a real historical base are some of the important components of a collective identity the motivation aims to the establishment of a nation state which contributes decisively to the political assimilation of the nation s idea therefore according to sfetas without a common historical background a nation state cannot exist for this modern states have sought to prove their historical continuity justifying their existence this chapter aims is to explain the evolution of the macedonian identity macedonia has concerned historians not a few times and the name dispute between the republic of macedonia and greece is only the last aspect of it in fact macedonia has been the apple of discord between the balkan states especially at the end of the ottoman sovereignty and for its lands took place the balkan wars this chapter examines macedonia from a historical perspective in order to offer a deeper understanding of the dispute it is necessary to begin from the ancient years not for literal interest but because the dispute between the republic of macedonia and greece has an emotional and theoretical aspect ancient macedonia five zero zero bc to one four six bc for a more complete treatment of early macedonia see macedon classical macedonia and environs from alexander g findlay s classical atlas to illustrate ancient geography new york one eight four nine macedonia is

bitola district in the south of today s republic of macedonia by five zero zero bc the early macedonian kingdom had become subject to the persian empire but played no significant part in the wars between the persians and the greeks king alexander i of macedon died four five zero bc was the first macedonian king to play a significant role in greek politics promoting the adoption of the attic dialect and culture under the rule of philip ii of macedon in the four th century bc macedon extended its control over the region of modern day northern greece philip s son alexander the great created an even bigger empire not only conquering the entire balkan region but also seizing control of the persian empire egypt and lands as far east as the fringes of india much of the impetus towards the creation of a common identity was provided by alexander the great alexander s conquests produced an extension of hellenic culture throughout the ancient near east but his empire broke up upon word of his death his generals divided the empire between them founding their own states and dynasties notably antigonus i antipater lysimachus perdiccas ptolemy i and seleucus i macedon itself was taken control by cassander who ruled it until his death in two nine seven bc antigonus ii took control in two seven seven bc following a period of civil strife during his long reign which lasted until two three nine bc he successfully restored macedonian prosperity despite losing control of many of the subjugated greek city states his successor antigonus iii reigned two two nine bc two two one bc re established macedonian power across the region macedon sovereignty was brought to an end at the hands of the rising power of rome in the two nd century bc philip v of macedon took his kingdom to war against the romans in two wars during his reign two two one bc one seven nine bc the first macedonian war two one five bc two zero five bc was fairly successful for the macedonians but philip was decisively defeated in the second macedonian war in two zero zero bc one nine seven bc although he survived war with rome his successor perseus of macedon reigned one seven nine bc one six eight bc did not having taken macedon into the third macedonian war in one seven one bc one six eight bc he lost his kingdom and his life when he was defeated macedonia was initially divided into four republics subject to rome before finally being annexed in one four six bc as the first roman province classical ages macedonian history has its roots deep in time however modern scholars dispute its origins some scholars believe that the ancient macedonians were a hellenic tribe dorians to be exact whose presence is believed can be dated earlier than the nine th century bc some scholars in contrast believe that the greek identity of macedonia is not supportable to support their claim they note that ancient and classical authros did not recognise macedonians as their fellow country men calling them barbarians forigners furthermore to support their claim these scholars indicate that ancient and classical historians made clear distinctions between the greeks and macedonians ethnically culturally and linguistically useful to their research are the ancient texts the following are only some of the passages of several ancient authors which make the above mentioned comments and distinctions diodorus siculus ancient greek historian said the following the macedonians and alexander backed coragus because he was one of them while the greeks favored dioxippus one seven one zero zero four when perdiccas heard of the revolt of the greeks he drew by lot from the macedonians three zero zero zero infantry and eight zero zero horsemen one eight seven three now that this great force had been added to the athenians the greeks who far outnumbered the macedonians were successful one eight one two four then after such a combat i have described the battle was broken off as the scales of victory swung in favour of the macedonians more then five zero zero of the greeks were killed in the battle and one three zero of the macedonians one eight one seven five the commandant of the garrison of that city archelaus who was a macedonian by race welcomed attalus and surrendered the city to him one eight three seven three four strabo ancient historian and geographer said the thessalians in particular wore long robes probably because they of all the greeks lived in the most northerly and coldest region one one one four one two note macedon is located north of thessaly quintus curtius rufus roman historian said alexander speaking to his macedonians where is that shout of yours that shows your enthusiasm where that characteristic look of my macedonians the history of alexander penguin classics p two one seven in contrast strabo one st century bc also says of course macedonia is a part of hellas he defines the frontiers of macedonia including more or less the whole south balkan peninsula with lands streching from albania to the republic of macedonia to bulgaria turkey and greece we should note that this frontier differs from the one that splits macedonia in three parts aegean greece vardar the republic of macedonia and the pirin bulgaria the official historiography of the republic of macedonia argues that the greeks considered the macedonian domination in greece as an alien rule imported from outside by the members of other tribes the as plutarch says allophyloi different nation however the greeks believe that the macedonians were enjoying great appreciation among the ancient greeks for instance king alexander a four nine eight four five four bc was honored by a special decree in the olympic games for his contribution to the greek struggle against the persians he received the title of philellin which means friend of the greeks these titles were bestowed to alexander because he was the first macedonian king to show an interest in the affairs and politics of the greeks in addition the greeks believe philip was a rough king who wanted to reign over greece they believe that he had greek conscience and that he had decided upon his persian expedition both to exact revenge for the persian invasions of european greece in the five th century bc and to liberate greece of asia from persia they also believe that alexander the great had greek culture under the strict order of his father who admired greek knowledge and he was educated by the philosopher aristotle of makedon besides he was dreaming of a long peace embracing all greek states holding high ideals of hellenism and seeking to promote them widely alexander assumed the roles of king of macedon as well as the leader of the league of corinth boldly he committed himself to the liberation of the greeks of asia minor who had been subjects to the persian empire for many decades for this he was being spontaneously worshipped as a living god by the asiatic greeks during the times of philip the greek cities were in dispute with macedonia however the greeks believe that the opposition of sparta or thebes was not because of a barbaric origin of the macedonians but for political reasons furthermore the greeks believe that demosthenes an athenian politician was a hard adversary of philip s policy and as a result calls him barbarian but not the macedonians as a whole they believe that it is totally accepted that this characterization was cultural and not ethnic and it is he who admits that the macedonians live at the centre of greece his anti macedonian feelings the greeks believe are also a result of the political mentality of the south against the north democracy against monarchy and philip had diminished the political freedom of the greeks lastly the greeks believe that three elements constituted the commonality of the ancient greeks common language common religion and participation to the olympic games they believe that the macedonians were fulfilling all three conditions and as a result hardly anyone could disprove their greek identity they believe that the macedonian language was greek differing from the neighboring ancient illyrian and thracian languages in contrast stardelov argues that the macedonian mother language was not understood by the greeks and greek names had only the aristocracy of macedonia but alongside them are to be found names which cannot be explained by means of greek etymology the greeks state however that he does not give any example thus renders his point meaningless martis based on herodotus supports that macedonians have always spoken greek because the greek peoples have always spoken the same tongue and andriotis says that the macedonian names were greek without exception moreover the greeks believe that the macedonians used to worship the olympian gods because many ancient greek temples are situated alongside in other words border macedonian territory finally they believe the macedonians were accepted to the olympic games like all the other greek tribes roman and byzantine period the macedonian state succeeded rome that conquered greece one four six bc the empire s division into two states made macedonia a province of the eastern one with the city of thessalonica becoming an important trade and cultural centre of the byzantine state which soon adopted the greek idiosyncrasy with the advancement of the macedonian s dynasty on the throne despite its power from the beginning of the six th century the byzantine dominions were subject to frequent massive movements and attacks on the part of the trans danubian slavs in the beginning of the seven th century at the time when domestic troubles weakened the defenses at the northern frontier of the byzantine state they made their settlement between the danube and the aimos range from then onwards slavic invasions were carried on intermittently and slavic penetrations of the northern parts of the balkan peninsula continued either in the form of war like invasions and the capture of greeks when the byzantine army was fighting on other fronts or by the peaceful settlement of slavic peasants and shepherds when those invaders submitted to byzantine rule medieval macedonia with the division of the roman empire into west and east in three nine five ad macedonia came under the rule of rome s byzantine successors whereas the byzantine state s prevailing greek culture flourished in thessaloniki and the aegean sea littoral the rest of macedonia was settled from around six zero zero ad by slavs with slavic tribes reaching as far south as thessaly and the peloponnese the bulk of the slavs settled in the north of the region but substantial slavic populations also settled in what is now the northern part of greek macedonia the population of the entire region was however severely depleted by destructive invasions of visigoths huns and vandals in the five th and the six th centuries a number of slavic tribes settled in macedonia central hellas thessaly and peloponnesos they were referred to by byzantine historians as sklavines the sklavines represented a solid mass in most of inland macedonia but in the aegean sea littoral thessaly and peloponnesos they lived alongside the indigenous greek population although the sklavines participated in several assaults against the byzantine empire alone or aided by bulgars or avars they generally recognised the authority of the byzantine emperor until eight three seven ad when most of inland macedonia was incorporated into bulgaria by bulgarian khan presian there are no byzantine records of sklavines after eight three six eight three seven as the slavs of inland macedonia gradually merged with the bulgars to form the bulgarian people while those living in the aegean sea littoral the chalcidice peninsula and inland greece were gradually forced upwards further north or expelled by the indigenous greek population and the byzantine emperors at the end of the one zero th century macedonia turned into the political and cultural centre of bulgaria as byzantine emperor basil ii conquered the eastern part of the country including the capital of preslav in nine seven two a new capital was established at ohrid which also became the seat of the bulgarian patriarchate after several decades of almost incessant war bulgaria fell under byzantine rule in one zero one eight the whole of macedonia was incorporated into the byzantine empire as the province of bulgaria and the bulgarian patriarchate was reduced in rank to an archbishopric in the one three th and one four th century byzantine control was punctuated by periods of bulgarian and serbian rule in the north conquered by the ottoman army in the first half of the one five th century macedonia remained a part of the ottoman empire for nearly five zero zero years during which it gained a substantial turkish minority thessaloniki later becomes the home of a large jewish population following spain s expulsions of jews after one four nine two ottoman period the ottomans in their struggle to capture constantinople included many slavs in their army who after the fall of the empire settled places in the greek mainland in spite of belonging to the same race these populations never felt a common national feeling and most of them were absorbed by the greek nation the slavs of the ottoman macedonia were members of the orthodox millet according to the ottoman administration system that was recognizing religious and not national identities and they were equalized politically with the greeks macedonia s division map of the region contested by serbia and bulgaria and subject to the arbitration of the russian tsar after the revival of greek serbian and bulgarian statehood in the one nine th century macedonia became a focus of the national ambitions of all three governments leading to the creation in the one eight nine zero s and one nine zero zero s of rival armed groups who divided their efforts between fighting the turks and one another the most important of these was the internal macedonian revolutionary organization vmro under goce delchev who in one nine zero three rebelled in the ilinden uprising and the greek efforts from one nine zero four till one nine zero eight greek struggle for macedonia diplomatic intervention by the european powers led to plans for an autonomous macedonia under ottoman rule the birth of nationalism and of the macedonian identity the next centuries macedonia became a rather multicultural region inhabited by greeks macedonians turks albanian gypsies jews and vlachs the birth of the modern greek state in one eight three zero disappointed with its small borders the greeks of northern greece epirus and macedonia regarding these concerns in one eight four four the greek prime minister kolettis addressed the constitutional assembly in athens that the kingdom of greece is not greece it is only a part the smallest and poorest of greece the greek is not only he who inhabits the kingdom but also he who lives in ioannina epirus or thessalonica macedonia or seres macedonia or andrianople thrace he mentions cities and islands that were under ottoman possession composing the great idea which dreamt of a reconstructed classical greek world or byzantine state the important here is that for greece macedonia was a region with mass greek populations expecting liberty to come then also the region which today is the modern republic of macedonia was known as the fief of skopje the big changes of the congress of berlin one eight seven eight changed the balkan map again the treaty restored macedonia and thrace to the ottoman empire serbia romania and montenegro were granted full independence granted some territory expansion at the expense of the ottoman empire russia would maintain an occupying force in bulgaria and eastern rumelia until may one nine seven nine austria hungary was permitted to occupy bosnia herzegovina and the sanjak of novi pazar san stefano bulgaria s size april one eight seven eight was reduced at the half losing macedonia the territorial losses dissatisfied bulgaria whose ambition was to review the treaty besides serbia was now interested in macedonian lands as well as greece that after the addition of thessaly one eight eight one was bordering them thus the berlin congress renewed the struggle for macedonia rather than setting up a permanent regime the following years all neighboring states would seek to conquest the macedonian lands and it was merely a strenuous process not only because of the capabilities of the ottoman army but mainly because the great powers were officially engaged in balkan politics conversely to slovenians croats serbians and albanians that beyond the lack of a state tradition in favor of protestantism enlightment or napoleonic policy they kept their lingual and slavic identity someone would have objections to accept the ethnic identity of moldavians bosnian muslims and macedonians the latter s identities were shaped basically for political reasons of external factors which are analyzed below the moldavian nation was serving the russian romanian competition the bosnian muslim nation was serving the serbian croatian competition and the macedonian nation was serving the serbian bulgarian competition in other words the macedonian identity was invented to serve the effort of bulgaria and serbia to control these lands the serbian policy had a distinct anti bulgarian orientation preventing the influence of the bulgarian exarchate established in one eight seven zero to the inhabitants of macedonia on the other hand bulgaria was using the power of its religious institution to promote its language and make more people feel bulgarians bramos argues that behind bulgarian foreign policy was hidden the russian factor who wanted to acquire an exit to aegean sea and a serious obstacle was the greek influence on macedonia greece in addition was in the advantageous position to protect its interests through the influence of the patriarchate of constantinople responsible for educational issues because of sponsoring schools in greek language was in dispute with the exarchate the protector of the bulgarian interests indeed belonging to one or another institution could define the national identity precisely if someone supported the patriarchate s authority was regarded greek while if the same person supported the exarchate s was regarded bulgarian macedonian identity is a result of the balance of power in balkans the aim of the adversaries was not to bring macedonia closer to each one but to keep it far from the opponent this often violent attempt to persuade the people that they belong to one ethnic group or another pushed someone to reject both the harsh pressure on the peaceful peasants of macedonia worked reverse to the plans of the serbians and bulgarians to make them adopt their ethnic idea and eventually a social distinction erected a british ambassador in belgrade in one nine two seven was reporting on this at present the unfortunate macedonian peasant is between the hammer and the anvil one day comitadjis come to his house and demand under threat lodging food and money and the next day the gendarm hales him off to prison for having given them the macedonian is really a peaceable fairly industrious agriculturist and if the serbian government give him adequate protection education freedom from malaria and decent communications there seems no reason why he should not become just as serbian in sentiment as he was bulgarian one zero years ago in actual fact the slavs of macedonia did not have any national identity this was the result serbian bulgarian propaganda moreover when the imperialistic plans of the surrounding states made possible the division of macedonia some macedonian intellectuals such as misirkov mentioned the necessity of creating a macedonian national identity which would diverse the macedonian slavs from bulgarians serbians or greeks baptizing macedonian slavs serbian or bulgarians aimed therefore to justify these countries territorial claims over macedonia the greek side with the assistance of the patriarchate that was responsible for the schools could easier maintain control because they were spreading the greek identity for the very same reason the bulgarians preparing the exarchate s regulation one eight seven one included macedonians in the assembly as brothers to prevent any ethnic diversification on the other hand the serbs unable to establish serbian speaking schools waged propaganda their main concern was to prevent the slavic speaking macedonians from acquiring bulgarian conscience concentrated on the myth of their ancient origins and simultaneously with the classification of bulgarians as tatars and not as slavs emphasizing their macedonian characteristics as an intermediate stage between serbs and bulgarians to sum up the serbian propaganda blocked by the bulgarian to persuade the slavs of macedonia of being serbians chose to inspire them a separate ethnic identity to diminish the bulgarian influence this choice was the macedonian ethnicity the bulgarians never accepted an ethnic diversity from the slav macedonians giving geographic meaning to the term in one eight nine three they established the vmro internal macedonian revolutionary organization aiming to confront the serbian and greek action in macedonia vmro hoped to succeed in the macedonian question through a revolutionary movement for this they instigated the ilinden uprising one nine zero three to release some ottoman territory bulgaria used it to internationalise the macedonian question ilinden changed greece s stance which decided to take para military action for a first time and in order to protect the greek macedonians and interests greece sent officers to train guerrillas and organise militias known as makedonomahoi macedonian fighters oriented basically against the bulgarians after that it was obvious that the macedonian question could be answered only with a war the rise of the albanian and the turkish nationalism after one nine zero eight however prompted greece serbia and bulgaria to bury their differences with regard to macedonia and to form a joint coalition against the ottoman empire in one nine one two disregarding public opinion in bulgaria which was in support of the establishment of an autonomous macedonian province under a christian governor the bulgarian government entered a pre war treaty with serbia which divided the region into two parts the part of macedonia west and north of the line of partition was contested by both serbia and bulgaria and was subject to the arbitration of the russian tsar after the war serbia formally renounced any claims to the part of macedonia south and east of the line which was declared to be within the bulgarian sphere of interest the pre treaty between greece and bulgaria however did not include any agreement on the division of the conquered territories evidently both countries hoped to occupy as much territory as possible having their sights primarily set on thessaloniki ottoman territories occupied by bulgaria serbia greece and montenegro after the first balkan war in the first balkan war bulgaria serbia greece and montenegro occupied almost all ottoman held territories in europe bulgaria bore the brunt of the war fighting on the thracian front against the main ottoman forces both her war expenditures and casualties in the first balkan war were higher than those of serbia greece and montenegro combined macedonia itself was occupied by greek serbian and bulgarian forces the ottoman empire in the treaty of london in may one nine one three assigned the whole of macedonia to the balkan league without specifing the division of the region in order to promote problems between the allies dissatisfied with the creation of an autonomous albanian state which denied her access to the adriatic serbia asked for the suspension of the pre war division treaty and demanded from bulgaria greater territorial concessions in macedonia later in may the same year greece and serbia signed a secret treaty in thessaloniki stipulating the division of macedonia according to the existing lines of control both serbia and greece as well as bulgaria started to prepare for a final war of partition macedonia s division in one nine one three in june one nine one three bulgarian tsar ferdinand without consulting the government and without any declaration of war ordered bulgarian troops to attack the greek and serbian troops in macedonia initiating the second balkan war the bulgarian army was in full retreat in all fronts the serbian army chose to stop its operations when achieved all its territorial goals and only then the bulgarian army took a breath during the last two days the bulgarians managed to achieve a defensive victory against the advancing greek army in the kresna gorge however at the same time the romanian army crossed the undefended northern border and easily advanced towards sofia romania interfered in the war in order to satisfy its territorial claims against bulgaria the ottoman empire also interfered easily reassuming control of eastern thrace with edirne the second balkan war also known as inter ally war left bulgaria only with the struma valley and a small part of thrace with minor ports at the aegean sea vardar macedonia was incorporated into serbia and thereafter referred to as south serbia southern aegean macedonia was incorporated into greece and thereafter was referred to as norther greece the region suffered heavily during the second balkan war during its advance at the end of june the greek army set fire to the bulgarian quarter of the town of kukush kilkis and over one six zero villages around kukush and serres driving some five zero zero zero zero refugees into bulgaria proper the bulgarian army retaliated by burning the greek quarter of serres and by arming muslims from the region of drama which led to a massacre of greek civilians in september of one nine one five the greek government allowed the landing of the troops of the allies in thessaloniki in one nine one six the pro german king of greece agreed with the germans to allow military forces of the central powers to enter greek macedonia in order to attack the forces of the allies in thessaloniki as a result of that bulgarian troops occupied the eastern part of greek macedonia with the port of kavala the region was however restored to greece following the victory of the allies in one nine one eight after the destruction of the greek army in asia minor in one nine two two greece and turkey exchanged most of macedonia s turkish minority and the greek inhabitants of thrace and anatolia as a result of which aegean macedonia experienced a large addition to its population and became overwhelmingly greek in ethnic composition serbian ruled macedonia was incorporated into the kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes later the kingdom of yugoslavia in one nine one eight yugoslav macedonia was subsequently subjected to an intense process of serbianization during the one nine two zero s and one nine three zero s during world war ii the boundaries of the region shifted yet again when the german forces occupied the area most of yugoslav macedonia and part of aegean macedonia were transferred for administration to bulgaria during the bulgarian admininstration of eastern greek macedonia some one zero zero zero zero zero bulgarian refugees from the region were resettled there and perhaps as many greeks were deported or fled to greece western aegean macedonia was occupied by italy with the western parts of yugoslav macedonia being annexed to italian occupied albania the remainder of greek macedonia including all of the coast was occupied by nazi germany one of the worst episodes of the holocaust happened here when six zero zero zero zero jews from thessaloniki were deported to extermination camps in occupied poland only a few thousand survived macedonia was liberated in one nine four four when the red army s advance in the balkan peninsula forced the german forces to retreat the pre war borders were restored under u s and british pressure because the bulgarian government was insisting to keep its military units on greek soil the bulgarian macedonia returned fairly rapidly to normality but the bulgarian patriots in yugoslav macedonia underwent a process of ethnic cleansing by the belgrade authorities and greek macedonia was ravaged by the greek civil war which broke out in december one nine four four and did not end until october one nine four nine after this civil war a large number of former elas fighters who took refuge in communist bulgaria and yugoslavia and described themselves as ethnic bulgarian macedonian were prohibited from reestablishing to their former estates by the greek authorities most of them were accused in greece for crimes committed during the period of the german occupation macedonia in balkan wars world war i and ii the balkan wars the decline of the ottoman empire and its imminent collapse was what the balkan states had been waiting to inherit its european territory the young turks revolution one nine zero eight proved a nationalistic movement thwarting the peoples expectations of the empire s modernization and sped up the end of the ottoman occupation of balkans to this direction was oriented the alliance between the balkan states in the spring one nine one three precisely the first balkan war which lasted six weeks commenced on eight one zero one nine one two when montenegro declared war on the ottoman empire whose forces finally fought four different wars in thrace macedonia northern and southern albania and kosovo the macedonian campaign which is the main concern of this chapter was fought in atrocious conditions the retreat of the ottoman army from macedonia succeeded the desperate effort of the greek and bulgarian forces to reach the city of thessalonica the single prize of the first balkan war for whose status no prior agreements were done in this case possession would be equal to acquisition the greek forces entered the city first liberating officially a progress only positive for them glenny says for the greeks it was a good war the first balkan war managed to liberate balkans from turks and settled the major issues except macedonia in the spring one nine one three the serbs and greeks begun the serbianization and the hellenization of the parts in macedonia they already controlled while bulgarians faced some difficulties against the jews and the turkish populations moreover the possession of thessalonica was a living dream for the bulgarians that were preparing for a new war for this the bulgarian troops had a secret order to launch surprise attacks on the serbs greece and serbia acknowledging the bulgarian plans signed a bilateral defensive agreement may one nine one three consequently greece and serbia decided to attack bulgaria in its moment of maximum weakness exhausted by its sacrifice the previous winter besides they had to fight also the romanians who were claim bulgarian lands the treaty of bucharest august one nine one three took off most of the bulgarian conquests of the previous years large part of macedonia became southern serbia including the territory of what today is the republic of macedonia and aegean macedonia became northern greece greece almost doubled its territory and population size and its northern frontiers remain today more or less the same since the balkan wars however when serbia acquired vardarska banovina the region of vardar macedonia modern republic of macedonia it launched having expansionist views aiming to descend to the aegean with thessalonica as he highest ambition however greece after the population exchange with bulgaria soon after its victory in the balkan wars managed to give national homogeneity in the aegean and any remaining slavic speakers were softly absorbed world war i after world war i the status quo of macedonia remained the same the establishment of the kingdom of serbians croats and slovenes in one nine one eight which in one nine two nine was renamed yugoslavia south slavia predicted no special regime for skopje neither recognized any macedonian national identity in fact the claims to macedonian identity remained silent at a propaganda level because eventually north macedonia had been a serbian conquest the situation in serbian macedonia changed after the revolution in russia one nine one eight one nine one nine according to sfetas comintern was handling macedonia as an matter of tactics depending on the political circumstances in early one nine two zero s supported the position for a single and independent macedonia in a balkan soviet democracy in actual fact the soviets wished a common frontier of the bulgarian communist agriculturists and the bulgarian macedonian societies in order to destabilize the balkan peninsula vmro under the protection of comintern promoted the idea of an independent macedonia in a federation of balkan states unifying all macedonians however the possible participation of bulgaria in a new war on the axon s side ended the soviet support some years later world war ii and beyond during the german occupation of greece one nine four one one nine four four the greek communist party kke was the main resistance factor with its military branch eam elas national liberating frontier although many members of eam were slavic speaking they had either bulgarian greek or distinct macedonian conscience to take advantage of the situation kke established snof macedonian liberating frontier one nine four three with the cooperation of the yugoslav leader tito who was ambitious enough to make plans for the greek macedonia for this he established the anti fascistic assembly for the national liberation of macedonia asnom giving an actual liberating character to the whole region of macedonia besides kke was very positive to the option of a greater macedonia including the greek region since it realised that a victory in the greek civil war was utopic later eam and snof disagreed in issues of policy and they finally crashed and the former was expelled from greece one nine four four yugoslav macedonia was the only region that tito had not developed a partisan movement because of the bulgarian occupation of a large macedonian area to the improvement of the situation in one nine four three was established the communist party of macedonia in tetovo with the prospect that it would support the resistance against axon in the meanwhile the bulgarians proved very violent losing any moral support from the civilians in the end of the war a macedonia national consciousness hardly existed beyond a general conviction gained from bitter experience that rule from sofia was as unpalatable as that from belgrade bur if there were no macedonian nation there was a communist party of macedonia around which the people s republic of macedonia was built in august one nine four four tito established people s republic of macedonia firstly he limited the serbian territory and secondly he implied with his political decision that only macedonia of bardar was liberated whilst the aegean and pirin were still under foreign occupation the end of the war did not bring peace to greece and a strenuous civil war between the government forces and eam broke out with about five zero zero zero zero casualties for both sides the defeat of the communists one nine four nine forced its slav speaking members to leave greece followed by the last non greek speaking inhabitants since one nine two three the only internationally recognized minority in greece are the muslims in west thrace the yugoslav communist leader josip broz tito separated yugoslav macedonia from serbia after the war it became a republic of the new federal yugoslavia as the socialist republic of macedonia in one nine four six with its capital at skopje tito also promoted the concept of a separate macedonian nation as a means of severing the ties of the slav population of yugoslav macedonia with bulgaria although the macedonian language is very close to bulgarian the differences were deliberately emphasized and the region s historical figures were promoted as being uniquely macedonian rather than serbian or bulgarian a separate macedonian orthodox church was established splitting off from the serbian orthodox church but it has not been recognised by any other orthodox church including the ecumenical patriarchate of constantinople the communist party sought to deter pro bulgarian sentiment which was punished severely convictions were still being handed down as late as one nine nine one tito had a number of reasons for doing this first as an ethnic croat he wanted to reduce serbia s dominance in yugoslavia establishing a territory formerly considered serbian as an equal to serbia within yugoslavia achieved this effect secondly he wanted to sever the ties of the macedonian slav population with bulgaria as recognition of that population as bulgarian would have undermined the unity of the yugoslav federation third of all tito sought to justify future yugoslav claims towards the rest of macedonia pirin and aegean in the name of the liberation of the region the potential macedonian state would remain as a constituent republic within yugoslavia and so yugoslavia would manage to get access to the aegean sea tito s designs on macedonia were asserted as early as august one nine four four when in a proclamation he claimed that his goal was to reunify all parts of macedonia divided in one nine one two and one nine one three by balkan imperialists to this end he opened negotiations with bulgaria for a new federal state which would also probably have included albania and supported the greek communists in the greek civil war the idea of reunification of all of macedonia under communist rule was abandoned as late as one nine four nine when the greek communists lost and tito fell out with the soviet union and pro soviet bulgaria across the border in greece macedonians were seen as a potentially disloyal fifth column within the greek state by both the us and greece the existence of a slav minority was officially denied with macedonians referred to in official censuses as being merely slavophone greeks slavonic names were forbidden and a strip along the border was subjected to security restrictions greeks were resettled in the region many of whom emigrated especially to australia along with many greek speaking natives because of the hard economic conditions after the second world war and the greek civil war although there was some liberalization between one nine five nine and one nine six seven the greek military dictatorship re imposed harsh restrictions the situation gradually eased after greece s return to democracy although even as recently as the one nine nine zero s greece has been criticised by international human rights activists for harassing macedonian slav political activists who nonetheless are free to maintain their own political party rainbow party elsewhere in greek macedonia economic development after the war was brisk and the area rapidly became the most prosperous part of the region the coast was heavily developed for tourism particularly on the khalkidhiki peninsula bulgaria initially accepted the existence of a distinctive macedonian identity but it was under soviet and yugoslav pressure it had been agreed that pirin macedonia would join yugoslavian macedonia and for this reason the population was forced to declare itself macedonian in the one nine four six census this caused resentment and many people were imprisoned or interned in rural areas outside macedonia after tito s split from the soviet bloc this position was abandoned and the existence of a macedonian nation or language was denied attempts of macedonian historians after the one nine four zero s to claim a number of prominent figures of the one nine th century bulgarian cultural revival and armed resistance movement as macedonians has caused ever since a bitter resentment in sofia bulgaria has repeatedly accused the republic of macedonia of appropriating bulgarian national heroes and symbols and of editing works of literature and historical documents so as to prove the existence of a macedonian slav consciousness before the one nine four zero s the publication in the republic of macedonia of the folk song collections bulgarian folk songs by the miladinov brothers and songs of the macedonian bulgarians by serbian archaelogist verkovic under the politically correct titles collection and macedonian folk songs are some of the examples quoted by the bulgarians the issue has soured the relations of bulgaria with former yugoslavia and later with the republic of macedonia for decades the republic of macedonia and the nomination issue with greece about aegean macedonia the disintegration of yugoslavia the cold war froze the historical process in balkans greece cooperated with tito s yugoslavia even if he was rarely referring to the existence of a macedonian minority in greece provoking the latter s complaints the fall of the ussr however lead eventually to the break up of yugoslavia which started with the secession of slovenia and croatia one nine nine one shortly after these two countries the republic of macedonia declared its independence september one nine nine one under the strong objections of greece because of the use of a greek name according to the greek side greek historical heritage therefore any use of its name or symbols by another entity is unacceptable furthermore north greece is also called macedonia which creates confusion besides it is mentioned above that the macedonians had expansionist ideas considering that the macedonians supported that a large macedonian lives in greece this could bring disorder in the balkans once more in addition the republic of macedonia adopted as its national symbol the star of vergina the burial place of philip ii an artifact of the greek civilization an action insensitive and na ve however this is not to condemn the republic of macedonia greece did little effort to prevent this unpleasant situation in the past the greek governments did not wish to provoke problems to their relations with tito and yugoslavia in other cases the dictatorship of one nine six seven and the turkish invasion in cyprus one nine seven four detracted and monopolized greek foreign policy respectively and the hidden name of a small federal state seemed an issue of less importance when the crisis erupted the slav macedonians had an already shaped ethnic conscience even if on a mythic basis and it could not change from one day to another furthermore it was the first time to declare a fully independent state and be clearly distinct from the serbians and bulgarians a gift that they would not deny at any cost besides any name change would erase the historical basis and question the macedonian identity while more than three zero of the population was albanians expecting privileges to sum up greece objected to the recognition to protect regional stability and its own security but also for saving its own historical myth later is analyzed the aspect of international relations and the importance of size it will be explained why the eu refused to recognize republic of macedonia under a name not acceptable by all member states under the greek intolerance and that the internal politics influenced greek foreign policy furthermore the several initiatives of resolution are presented why greece embargoed the republic of macedonia even if as a greater power had other means to negotiate and also how did the adversaries reached the interim agreement that improved the relations of the neighbors since then the relations between the two countries are normal and greece has become the biggest industrial and trade partner of the republic of macedonia even if the name issue remains as communism fell throughout eastern europe in the late two zero th century macedonia followed its other federation partners and declared its independence from yugoslavia in late one nine nine one the new macedonian constitution took effect november two zero one nine nine one and called for a system of government based on a parliamentary democracy the first democratically elected coalition government was led by prime minister branko crvenkovski of the social democratic union of macedonia sdsm and included the ethnic albanian party for democratic prosperity pdp kiro gligorov became the first president of an independent macedonia president gligorov was the first president of a former yugoslav republic to relinquish office in accordance with the terms of the macedonian constitution his presidency ended in november one nine nine nine after eight years in office which included surviving a car bombing assassination attempt in one nine nine five he was succeeded by former deputy foreign minister boris trajkovski vmro who defeated tito petkovski sdsm in a second round run off election for the presidency november one four one nine nine nine trajkovski s election was confirmed by a december five one nine nine nine partial re vote in two three zero polling stations which the macedonian supreme court mandated due to election irregularities macedonia was the only republic of the former yugoslavia whose secession in one nine nine one was not clouded by ethnic or other armed conflict although the ethnic albanian population declined to participate in the referendum on independence during the yugoslav period macedonian ethnic identity exhibited itself in that most of macedonia s slavic population identified themselves as macedonians while several minority groups in particular ethnic albanians sought to retain their own distinct political culture and language although interethnic tensions simmered under yugoslav authority and during the first decade of its independence the country avoided ethnically motivated conflict until several years after independence the united states department of state controversy republic of macedonia and greece although no controversy exists in regards to whether or not parts of the historic region of macedonia are incorporated in the modern republic of macedonia as indeed part of the ancient macedonian kingdom is there is controversy however with regards to the slavic people who currently populate much of the region some believe in a so called slavic migration theory which states that the slavic people who currently populate much of the region of macedonia did not arrive in the balkans until approximately one zero zero zero years after the death of alexander the great as a result the appropriation of what greece considered ancient greek symbols by the people of macedonia fueled nationalist anger in greece this anger was reinforced by the legacy of the civil war and the view in many quarters that greece s slavic speaking populations were a disloyal minority the republic of macedonia s status became a heated political issue in greece where demonstrations took place in athens and thessaloniki in one nine nine two against the state under the slogan macedonia is greek referring to the name and history rather than the modern region as a whole the greek government objected formally to any use of the name macedonia including any derivative names and also to the use of symbols such as the vergina sun the controversy was not just nationalist but had much to do with internal greek politics as well the two leading greek political parties the ruling conservative new democracy under constantine mitsotakis and the socialist pasok under andreas papandreou sought to outbid each other in whipping up nationalist sentiment against the republic of macedonia to complicate matters further new democracy itself was divided mitsotakis favoured a compromise solution on the macedonian question while his foreign minister antonis samaras took a hard line approach the two eventually fell out and samaras was sacked with mitsotakis reserving the foreign ministry for himself he failed to reach an agreement on the macedonian issue despite united nations mediation and fell from power in october one nine nine three largely as a result of his handling of the issue when papandreou took power following the october one nine nine three elections he restated his party s hard line position on the issue the united nations recommended recognition of the republic of macedonia under the temporary name of the former yugoslav republic of macedonia or fyrom for short which would be used internationally while the country continued to use republic of macedonia as its constitutional name the united states and european union agreed to this proposal and duly recognized macedonia prompting demonstrations in greek cities against what was termed a betrayal by greece s allies papandreou supported and encouraged the demonstrations boosting his own popularity by taking the hard line against the republic of macedonia in february one nine nine four he imposed a total trade embargo on the country with the exception of food and medicines the effect on the republic of macedonia s economy was devastating the blockade also had a political cost for greece as there was little understanding or sympathy for the country s position and exasperation over what was seen as greek obstructionism from some of its european union partners greece was criticized in some quarters for contributing to the rising tension in the balkans even if the wars in the former yugoslavia were widely seen as having been triggered by the premature recognition of its successor republics by other european countries a move to which greece had objected from the beginning it later emerged that greece had only agreed to the dissolution of yugoslavia in return for eu solidarity on the macedonian issue in one nine nine four the european commission took greece to the european court of justice in an effort to overturn the embargo but before a ruling could be reached as a result of international pressure the republic of macedonia and greece entered into an interim agreement in which the republic of macedonia agreed to remove any implied territorial claims to the greater macedonia region from its constitution and to drop the vergina sun from its flag in return greece lifted the blockade discussions continue over the greek objection regarding the country s name but without any resolution so far outside greece and international diplomatic settings the country is usually simply called macedonia about four zero countries notably the united states people s republic of china and russian federation have recognised it by its constitutional name while the remaining majority of countries the united nations and other international organisations recognize it as the former yugoslav republic of macedonia often abbreviated as fyrom controversy republic of macedonia and bulgaria bulgarian governments throughout the period continued their policy of non recognition of macedonians as a distinct ethnic group there were repeated complaints of official harassment of macedonian slav activists in the one nine nine zero s attempts of slav macedonian separatist organisation umo ilinden to commemorate the grave of revolutionary yane sandanski throughout the one nine nine zero s were usually hampered by the bulgarian police several incidents of mobbing of umo ilinden members by bulgarian imro activists were also reported after the bulgarian electoral committee endorsed in two zero zero one the registration of a wing of umo ilinden which had dropped separatist demands from its charter the mother organisation became largely inactive no major incidents or harassment has been reported since then similar cases of harassment of pro bulgarian organisations and activists have been reported in the republic of macedonia in two zero zero zero several teenagers threw smoke bombs at the conference of pro bulgarian organisation radko in skopje causing panic and confusion among the delegates the perpetrators were afterwards acclaimed by the macedonian press as national heroes radko was later banned by the macedonian constitutional court as separatist the organisation has continued its activity though mostly in the cultural field front cover of songs of the macedonian bulgarians by stefan verkovic first edition one eight six zero in two zero zero one radko issued in skopje the original version of the folk song collection bulgarian folk songs by the miladinov brothers issued under an edited name in the republic of macedonia and viewed as a collection of slav macedonian lyrics the book triggered a wave of other publications among which the memoirs of the greek bishop of kastoria in which he talked about the greek bulgarian church struggle at the beginning of the two zero th century as well the report of the carnegie commission on the causes and conduct of the balkan wars from one nine one three neither of these addressed the slavic population of macedonia as macedonian slav but as bulgarian being the first publications to question the official macedonian position of the existence of a distinct macedonian slav identity going back to the time of alexander the great the books triggered a reaction of shock and disbelief in macedonian slav public opinion the scandal after the publication of bulgarian folk songs resulted in the sacking of the macedonian minister of culture dimitar dimitrov as from two zero zero zero bulgaria started to grant bulgarian citizenship to members of the bulgarian minorities in a number of countries including the republic of macedonia the vast majority of the applications have been from macedonian citizens as at may two zero zero four some one four zero zero zero macedonians had applied for a bulgarian citizenship on the grounds of bulgarian origin and four zero zero zero of them had already received their bulgarian passports the main reason behind this was the posibility to travel in european union and other countries without need of a visa which is still not possible having only the macedonian passport in june two zero zero four the macedonian state television announced with alarm that at least one member of every fourth household in the eastern part of the republic of macedonia had already received a bulgarian passport or had at least applied for one the last quoted number so far was of six three zero zero zero macedonians the number has not been confirmed

present day republic of macedonia five one in greece and one one in bulgaria see macedonia one nine one two one nine four four the valley of the river vardar which was later to become the central area of the republic of macedonia was ruled by the ottoman empire prior to the first balkan war of one nine one two it was captured by serbia during that war and was subsequently annexed to serbia in the post war peace treaties it had no administrative autonomy and was called ju na srbija southern serbia or stara srbija old serbia after the first world war the kingdom of serbia joined the newly formed kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes in one nine two nine the kingdom was officially renamed the kingdom of yugoslavia and was divided into provinces called banovinas the territory of the modern republic of macedonia became a part of the vardar banovina during world war ii the vardar banovina was occupied between one nine four one and one nine four four by italian ruled albania which annexed the albanian populated western regions and pro german bulgaria which occupied the remainder the occupying powers imposed a harsh regime on the province s inhabitants which prompted many of them to join the communist resistance movement of josip broz tito one nine four four one nine four nine following world war ii yugoslavia was reconstituted as a federal state under the leadership of tito s yugoslav communist party when the former vardar province was liberated in one nine four four most of it was made into a separate republic while the northernmost parts of the province remained with serbia in one nine four six the new republic was given federal status as an autonomous people s republic of macedonia within the new socialist federal republic of yugoslavia in the one nine six three constitution of yugoslavia it was slightly renamed to bring it into line with the other yugoslav republics as the socialist republic of macedonia greece was offended by the yugoslav government s actions as they were seen as pretext for future territorial claims since the greek province of northern greece which in one nine eight eight was renamed to province of macedonia was part of the spoils that greece received during the balkan wars and to which both serbia and bulgaria have made hystoric claims the yugoslav authorities also promoted the development of the macedonians ethnic identity and macedonian language the macedonian language was codified in one nine four four keith two zero zero three from the language spoken by the majority of the population in the republic of macedonia this angered both greece and bulgaria because of the possible territorial claims of the new states to the greek and bulgarian parts of the region of macedonia received after the balkan wars during the greek civil war one nine four four one nine four nine many macedonians regardless of ethnicity participated in the elas resistance movement organized by the greek communist party elas and yugoslavia were on good terms until one nine four nine when they split due to tito s lack of allegiance to stalin cf cominform after the end of the war the elas fighters who took refuge in southern yugoslavia and bulgaria were not all permitted to return to greece only those who considered themselves greeks were allowed whereas those who considered themselves bulgarians or macedonians were barred these events also contributed to the bad state of yugoslav greek relations in macedonia one nine nine zero s on september one seven one nine nine one the socialist republic of macedonia held a referendum that established its independence from yugoslavia under the name of the republic of macedonia bulgaria was the first country to recognize the republic of macedonia under its constitutional name however international recognition of the new country was delayed by greece s objection to the use of what it considered a hellenic name and national symbols as well as controversial clauses in the republic s constitution to compromise the united nations recognised the state under the name of the former yugoslav republic of macedonia in one nine nine three greece was still dissatisfied and it imposed a trade blockade in february one nine nine four the sanctions were lifted in september one nine nine five after the republic of macedonia changed its flag and apects of its constitution that were perceived as granting it the right to intervene in the affaires of third countries the two neighbours immediately went ahead with normalizing their relations but the state s name remains a source of local and international controversy the usage of each name remains controversial to supporters of the other after the state was admitted to the united nations under the temporary reference the former yugoslav republic of macedonia other international organisations adopted the same convention more than half of the un s member states have recognised the country as the republic of macedonia including the united states of america while the rest use the temporary reference the former yugoslav republic of macedonia or fyrom or have not established any diplomatic relations with republic of macedonia as of august two zero zero five poland became the one one two th country out of one nine one total members of un to recognize republic of macedonia under its constitutional name a permanent agreement between greece and the republic of macedonia s name has not yet been reached however the acceptance by greece of a temporary name that includes macedonia reflects athens willingness to accept a permanent name that includes macedonia the latest publicized proposal was republika makedonija skopje with that spelling but was rejected by the republic of macedonia the un mediator matthew nimitz proposed another form several months afterwards without publicizing the exact formulation but this form was rejected by greece in one nine nine nine the kosovo war led to nearly four zero zero zero zero zero albanian refugees from kosovo fleeing into the republic of macedonia greatly disrupting normal life in the region and threatening to upset the balance between macedonians and albanians refugee camps were set up in the republic of macedonia meanwhile athens rallied behind skopje and allowed greek macedonia to be used as a transit corridor for nato forces moving to the region ahead of a possible invasion of serbia thessaloniki became the main depot for humanitarian aid to the region the republic itself did not become involved in the conflict in the event the serbian government under president slobodan milo evi capitulated and the refugees were allowed home under un protection however the war increased tensions and relations between ethnic macedonians and albanian macedonians became strained on the possitive side athens and ankara presented a united front of non involvment in greece there was a strong reaction against nato and the united states but the small anti war political parties lost rather than gained support two zero zero zero s in the spring of two zero zero one ethnic albanian rebels calling themselves the national liberation army some of whom were former members of the kosovo liberation army took up arms in the west of the republic of macedonia they demanded that the constitution be rewritten to enshrine certain ethnic albanian interests such as language rights the guerillas received support from albanians in nato controlled kosovo and ethnic albanian guerrillas in the demilitarized zone between kosovo and the rest of serbia the fighting was concentrated in and around tetovo the second largest city in the republic after a joint nato serb crackdown on albanian guerillas in kosovo european union eu officials were able to negotiate a cease fire in june the government would give ethnic albanians greater civil rights and the guerilla groups would voluntarily relinquish their weapons to nato monitors this agreement was a success and in august two zero zero one three five zero zero nato soldiers conducted operations essential harvest to retrieve the arms directly after the operation finished in september the nla officially dissolved itself ethnic relations have since improved significantly although hardliners on both sides have been a continued cause for concern and some low level violence continues particularly directed against police on february two six two zero zero four president boris trajkovski died in a plane crash on the territory of bosnia and herzegovina the results of the official

fyrom pending a resolution to the long running dispute about the country s name other international bodies such as the european union nato european broadcasting union and the international olympic committee have adopted the same convention the un s member states all recognise the republic of macedonia but are divided over what to call it an increasing number of countries recognise the country by its constitutional name the republic of macedonia rather than the former yugoslav republic of macedonia or fyrom this notably includes three of the five un security council members the united states russia and the people s republic of china about one one zero countries are reported to recognise the country as the republic of macedonia this constitutes about five seven of the un s member states with more than nine zero of the population of un member states given that both names are rather long winded the state is often referred to simply as macedonia by non greeks international disputes albania the albanian government calls for the protection of the rights of ethnic albanians in the republic of macedonia while continuing to seek regional cooperation the two zero zero one conflict in macedonia between macedonia s majority macedonians and minority albanians caused some tensions between the two countries however the subsequent peace agreement and the implementation of greater rights for ethnic albanians has helped to stabilise the situation bulgaria bulgaria was the first country to recognize the independence of the republic of macedonia bulgaria has however refused to recognise the existence of a separate macedonian nation and a separate macedonian language it argues that the macedonians are a subgroup of the bulgarian nation and that the macedonian language is a dialect of bulgarian this leads to some complications when signing treaties between both countries they are signed with this long phrase in the end done in the official languages of the two states bulgarian language according to the constitution of the republic of bulgaria and macedonian language according to the constitution of the republic of macedonia bulgaria gives the macedonians the right to obtain bulgarian citizenship and an estimated one three zero zero zero of them who feel that they have bulgarian heritage have taken advantage of this macedonia has very good relations with bulgaria in the political economic and military spheres the governments of the two countries work to improve business relations bulgaria supports the macedonian bid to enter the eu and nato bulgaria has also donated tanks artillery and other military technology to the macedonian army greece the indeterminate status of the republic of macedonia s name arises from a long running dispute with greece which criticizes the use of what it considers to be an hellenic name and symbols the three main points of the dispute are the name the republic of macedonia is only part of the wider region of macedonia much of which is now in greece the flag the sixteen ray vergina sun symbol that appeared on the post independence flag of the republic of macedonia was a symbol of the ancient kingdom of macedon to which greece claims to be the sole heir see also vergina the constitution the republic of macedonia s constitution included articles that greece considered promoted separatism and territorial claims on its northern regions the naming issue was parked in a compromise agreed at the united nations in one nine nine three however greece refused to grant diplomatic recognition to the republic and imposed an economic blockade that lasted until the flag and constitutional issues were resolved in one nine nine five naming issue greek concerns over the name arise from a number of factors the name is historically associated with greek or at least greek speaking cultures notably that of the kingdom of macedon greeks consider that the inhabitants of the neighbouring republic most of whom are descendants of slavic tribes who moved into the region around the six th century ad have no moral or historical right to claim the name macedonia for themselves some macedonian nationalists and communist era yugoslav propagandists have tried to associate the republic with ancient macedon making a number of historically dubious claims the territory of the republic of macedonia was not called as such until one nine four four when it was split off from serbia and made into a separate republic thus although it is certainly part of the historical region of macedonia there is no political continuity between ancient macedon and the modern republic of macedonia greece suspected that the republic of macedonia had territorial ambitions in the northern greek provinces of macedonia this has been a greek concern for decades as far back as one nine five seven the greek government expressed concern about reported yugoslav ambitions to create an independent people s republic of macedonia with the greek city of thessaloniki as its capital the naming issue has not yet been resolved but it has effectively reached a stalemate in one nine nine three the united nations obtained greece s acquiesence to the admission of the republic of macedonia by adopting the temporary name of the former yugoslav republic of macedonia or fyrom however much to the annoyance of the greek government the compromise is wearing increasingly thin many states have abandoned the un provisional reference the former yugoslav republic of macedonia or fyrom and have recognised the country as the republic of macedonia instead these include the permanent un security council members of the united states russia and the people s republic of china and the former yugoslavian republics of serbia and montenegro croatia bosnia herzegovina and slovenia in addition bulgaria and turkey have also recognized the nation by its constitutional name however all un member states have agreed to accept any final agreement resulting from negotiations between the two countries the dispute continues to excite passions in both nations but in practice the two countries deal pragmatically with each other economic relations and cooperation have resumed since one nine nine five to such an extent that greece is now considered one of the republic s most important foreign economic partners and investors within greece most greeks reject any use of the word macedonia to describe the republic of macedonia instead calling it skopje and its inhabitants skopjeans greek skopiani after the country s capital this metonymic solution has not been adopted by non greeks and many inhabitants of the republic regard it as insulting greek official sources sometimes use the term slavomacedonians to refer to the republic s inhabitants the united nations set a target of september one three two zero zero two for reaching a solution to the issue this date passed without any solution being found and it is unclear how the issue will be resolved given the apparently irreconcilable positions of the two sides the republic of macedonia says that it will not abandon the name macedonia while greece says that it will not accept any permanent name that includes macedonia the march two zero zero four application of the republic of macedonia for membership of the european union may help to speed efforts to find a solution in a meeting of one four september two zero zero four the eu noted that the difference over the name of the former yugoslav republic of macedonia still persists and encouraged parties to find a mutually acceptable solution but stated that it is not part of the conditions for eu accession in two zero zero five matthew nimitz un special representative for the country suggested using republika makedonija skopje sic for official purposes greece did not accept the proposal outright but characterized it as a basis for constructive negotiations prime minister vlado buckovski rejected the proposal and counterproposed a double formula where the international community uses republic of macedonia and greece uses former yugoslav republic of macedonia in october two zero zero five matthew nimitz made a new proposal it proposes that the name republika makedonija should be used by the one zero six countries that have recognized the country under that name it proposes also that greece should use the formula republika makedonija skopje while the international institutions and organizations should use the name republika makedonia in latin alphabet transcription while the government of the republic of macedonia accepted the proposal as a good basis for solving the dispute greece rejected the proposal as unacceptable flag issue the former flag of republic of macedonia used from one nine nine two one nine nine five republic of macedonia s first post independence flag caused a major controversy when it was unveiled the use of the vergina sun on the flag offended greeks as they regarded the symbol as being associated with king philip ii of macedon and by extension with his son alexander the great the greek viewpoint was summed up in an faq circulated on the internet in the late one nine nine zero s the vergina sun the emblem of philip s dynasty symbolizes the birth of our nation it was the first time four th century bc that the greek mainland city states and kingdoms with the same language culture and religion were united against the enemies of asia in one league at the same time the fractured greek world grew conscious of its unity and in this sense we have never been apart since then the sun was excavated in greece in one nine seven eight and it is sacred to us the symbol was removed from the flag under an agreement reached between the republic of macedonia and greece in september one nine nine five the republic agreed to meet a number of greek demands for changes to its national symbols and constitution while greece agreed to establish diplomatic relations with the republic and end its economic blockade constitutional issue the republic of macedonia s first post independence constitution adopted on november one seven one nine nine one included a number of clauses that greece interpreted as promoting secessionist sentiment among the slav speaking population of northern greece and making irredentist claims on greek territory article four nine of the constitution caused particular concern it read one the republic cares for the status and rights of those persons belonging to the macedonian people in neighboring countries as well as macedonian expatriates assists their cultural development and promotes links with them in the exercise of this concern the republic will not interfere in the sovereign rights of other states or in their internal affairs two the republic cares for the cultural economic and social rights of the citizens of the republic abroad in the greek view this was effectively a license for the republic to interfere in greek internal affairs the offending articles were removed under the one nine nine five agreement between the two sides serbia and montenegro a february two zero zero one agreement with serbia and montenegro settled the alignment of the boundary between the two countries mandating implementation within two years however ethnic albanians on both sides of the border have expressed opposition to the agreement due to the imposition of tighter border controls and the transfer of some territory to the macedonian side transnational issues the country is a major transshipment point for southwest asian heroin and hashish it is also a minor transit point for south american cocaine destined for europe

india about seven zero zero kilometers south west of sri lanka the two six atolls encompass a territory featuring one one nine two islets roughly two zero zero of which are inhabited by people the country s name may stand for the palace or mountain islands from al mahal in arabic or malai in malayalam mala in tamil and dvipa in sanskrit respectively or it might mean a thousand islands following the introduction of islam in one one five three the islands later became a portuguese one five five eight dutch one six five four and british one seven nine six colonial possession in one nine six five maldives declared its independence from britain and in one nine six eight the sultanate was replaced by a republic history western interest in the archaeological remains of early cultures on maldives began with the work of h c p bell a british commissioner of the ceylon civil service bell was shipwrecked on the islands in one eight seven nine and returned several times to investigate ancient buddhist ruins the early inhabitants of maldives were from present day kerala and probably spoke an archaic form of tamil a dravidian language in fact people in the neighbouring lakshadweep islands speak a form of malayalam that is an off shoot of archaic tamil but by the fourth century a d theravada buddhism originating from ceylon present day sri lanka became the dominant religion of the people of maldives some scholars believe that the name maldives derives from the sanskrit maladvipa meaning garland of islands in the mid one nine eight zero s the maldivian government allowed the noted explorer and expert on early marine navigation thor heyerdahl to excavate ancient sites heyerdahl studied the ancient mounds called hawitta by the maldivians found on many of the atolls some of his archaeological discoveries of stone figures and carvings from pre islamic civilizations are today exhibited in a side room of the small national museum on mal heyerdahl s research indicates that as early as two zero zero zero b c maldives lay on the maritime trading routes of early egyptian mesopotamian and indus valley civilizations heyerdahl believes that early sun worshipping seafarers called the redin first settled on the islands this was evident then in many mosques facing the sun and not mecca lending credence to this theory because building space and materials were scarce successive cultures constructed their places of worship on the foundations of previous buildings heyerdahl thus surmises that these sun facing mosques were built on the ancient foundations of the redin culture temples heyerdahl s early mosques have now in large part been converted to face mecca as islam gained solidarity in maldives in the earlier half of the modern republic according to maldivian legend a sinhalese prince named koimala was stranded with his bride daughter of the king of sri lanka in a maldivian lagoon and stayed on to rule as the first sultan from the house of theemuge prior to that mal had belonged a group of people today called as giravaaru who claim ancestry from ancient tamils tamilas according to clarence maloney a noted anthropologist there is a clear tamil substratum in the language which also appears in place names kin terms poetry dance and religious beliefs this is actually tamil malayalam as up to about the one zero th century when the malayalam language acquired a separate identity what is now kerala was considered to be part of the tamil area there are numerous references in the tamil sangam one st three rd century and medieval literature to kings of kerala having ships conducting invasions by sea and ruling the northern part of sri lanka people of kerala settled the lakshadvip islands and evidently viewed the maldives as an extension of them there is a maldivian epic about koimala who is said to have come from sri lanka bringing with him his royal lineage landing on a northern atoll and then making mal his capital but the name koi is from malayalam koya son of the prince which is also the name of a high caste group in the lakshadvip islands koimala has now become a generalized eponymous ancestor of the pre muslim divehis the medieval settlements from sri lanka were strongest in the southern islands and this gave rise to the divehi language buddhism and the ideals of kinship the maldivians followed buddhism before they converted to islam and the conversion is explained in a controversial mythological story about the demon rannamaari over the centuries the islands have been visited and their development influenced by sailors from countries on the arabian sea and the indian ocean littorals mappila pirates from the malabar coast present day kerala state in india harassed the islands although governed as an independent islamic sultanate for most of its history from one one five three to one nine six eight maldives was a british protectorate from one eight eight seven until july two five one nine six five in one nine five three there was a brief abortive attempt to form a republic but the sultanate was re imposed in one nine five nine objecting to nasir s changes the inhabitants of the three southernmost atolls protested against the government they formed the united suvadive republic and elected a president abdulla afeef didi after independence from britain in one nine six five the sultanate continued to operate for another three years on november one one one nine six eight it was abolished and replaced by a republic and the country assumed its present name tourism and fishing are now being developed on the archipelago in november one nine eight eight tamil mercenaries from sri lanka invaded the maldives after an appeal by the maldivian government for help india launched a military campaign to throw the mercenaries out of maldives on the night of november three one nine eight eight the indian air force airlifted a parachute battalion group from agra and flew them non stop over two zero zero zero km to maldives the indian paratroopers landed at hulule and secured the airfield and restored the government rule at mal within hours the brief bloodless operation showcased the capability of the indian air force and the indian navy in what was labelled operation cactus on two six december two zero zero four the maldives were devastated by a tsunami following the two zero zero four indian ocean earthquake the absence of land mass against which waves could be built up reduced the destructive impact preventing the waves from reaching much more than one two one five meters in height despite this the archipelago s low lying nature one of the lowest lying countries on earth meant that nearly all of the country was swamped at least seven five people perished including six foreigners and all infrastructure was lost on one three of the inhabited islands and two nine of the resort islands economy see also industries in maldives fisheries the maldivian economy was for many centuries entirely dependent on fishing and other marine products therefore fishing has been and still remains the main occupation of the people the government gives special priority to the development of the fisheries sector the mechanization of the traditional fishing dhoani in one nine seven four was a major milestone in the development of the fisheries industry and the country s economy in general a fish canning plant was installed in the island of felivaru in one nine seven seven as a joint venture with a japanese firm in one nine seven nine a fisheries advisory board was set up with the mandate of advising the government on policy guidelines for the overall development of the fisheries sector manpower development programs were begun in the early one nine eight zero s and fisheries education was incorporated into the school curriculum fish aggregating devices and navigational aids were located at various strategic points moreover the opening up of the exclusive economic zone eez of maldives for fisheries has further enhanced the growth of the fisheries sector today fisheries contribute over one five percent of the gdp and engage about three zero percent of the country s work force it is also the second largest foreign exchange earner after tourism tourism the capital of the maldives mal the development of tourism has fostered the overall growth of the country s economy it has created direct and indirect employment and income generation opportunities in other related industries today tourism is the country s biggest foreign exchange earner contributing to two zero percent of the gdp with eight six tourist resorts in operation the year two zero zero zero recorded four six seven one five four tourist arrivals cottage industries the development tourism sector gave a major boost to the country s fledging traditional cottage industries such as mat weaving lacquer work handicraft and coir rope making new industries that have since emerged include printing production of pvc pipes brick making marine engine repairs bottling of aerated water and garment production politics maumoon abdul gayoom was first elected president in one nine seven eight and has retained power more or less in a dictatorial manner he has survived a coup attempt that was foiled with help of indian troops in one nine eight eight at present he is the longest serving leader in asia since two zero zero three the country has experienced occasional antigovernment demonstrations calling for political reforms political parties were allowed in june two zero zero five the first party to register was the maldivian democratic party mdp headed by popular opposition figures such as mohamed nasheed anni and mohamed latheef gogo the dhivehi raiyyithunge party drp headed by president gayyoom was to register next judiciary ustaz mohamed rasheed ibrahim from fuvahmulah is the present chief justice of maldives maldives and the indian ocean commission since one nine nine six maldives has been the official progress monitor of the indian ocean commission in two zero zero two maldives applied for full membership but was refused the first reason they were rejected is that their geographical position is different from other member states maldives are considered in asia instead of africa the other reason was more complicated the official language spoken by the commission was french with creole used in friendly conversations maldives speak english and a language totally unrelated to the other members it was proposed to change the language to english which the people of reunion comoros and mayotte do not speak and so the idea was dropped the third reason was due to the difference in historic background however maldives were given a more important role and semi membership atolls satellite image of the maldives by nasa note that the southern most atoll of the maldives addu atoll is not visible on the image maldives has two six natural atolls which have been divided into two zero administrative atolls and one city the northern most atoll is haa alif atoll and the southern most is seenu the smallest atoll is gnaviyani atoll with only one island the largest island in maldives the largest atoll in both maldives and the whole world is gaafu alif atoll which is just south of the one and a half degree channel each atoll is administered by an atoll chief atholhu veriyaa appointed by the president maumoon abdul gayoom atoll chiefs administer as directed by the president the ministry of atoll administration and its northern and southern regional offices atoll offices and island offices are collectively responsible to the president for atolls administration the administrative head of each island is the island chief katheeb appointed by the president the island chief s immediate superior is the atoll chief geography maldives holds the record for being the flattest country in the world with a maximum altitude of only two three metres although there have been reports of rising sea levels threatening the islands the sea level has actually lowered in recent decades a tsunami in the indian ocean caused by the two zero zero four indian ocean earthquake caused parts of maldives to be covered by sea water and left many people homeless after the disaster cartographers are planning to redraw the maps of the islands due to alterations by the tsunami the people and government are worried that maldives could be wiped from the map eventually demographics the maldivian ethnic identity is a blend of the cultures of peoples who settled on the islands reinforced by religion and language the earliest settlers were probably from southern india indo aryan speakers followed them from sri lanka in the fourth and fifth centuries ad in the one two th century ad sailors from east africa and arab countries came to the islands originally buddhists maldivians were converted to sunni islam in the mid one two th century islam is the official religion of the entire population as adherence to it is required for citizenship strict adherence to islamic precepts and close community relationships have helped keep crime low and under control the official and common language is dhivehi an indo european language related to sinhalese the language of sri lanka the written script is called thaana and is written from right to left english is used widely in commerce and increasingly as the medium of instruction in government schools some social stratification along the lines similar to indian caste system exists on the islands it is not rigid since rank is based on varied factors including occupation wealth islamic virtue and family ties members of the social elite are concentrated in mal outside of the service industry this is the only location where the foreign and domestic populations are likely to interact the tourist resorts are not on islands where the natives live and casual contacts between the two groups are discouraged there still exists a small population of people called giravaaru who claim be the original settlers of maldives thus different from the maldivian

archipelagoes dive sites historical setting maldives is an isolated nation and is among the smallest and poorest countries in the world in olden times the islands provided the main source of cowrie shells then used as currency throughout asia and parts of the east african coast moreover historically maldives has had a strategic importance because of its location on the major marine routes of the indian ocean maldives nearest neighbors are sri lanka and india both of which have had cultural and economic ties with maldives for centuries although under nominal portuguese dutch and british influences after the one six th century maldivians were left to govern themselves under a long line of sultans and occasionally sultanas maldives gained independence in one nine six five the british who had been maldives last colonial power continued to maintain an air base on the island of gan in the southernmost atoll until one nine seven six the british departure in one nine seven six almost immediately triggered foreign speculation about the future of the air base the soviet union requested use of the base but maldives refused the greatest challenge facing the republic in the early one nine nine zero s was the need for rapid economic development and modernization given the country s limited resource base in fishing agricuture and tourism concern was also evident over a projected long term rise in sea level which would prove disastrous to the low lying coral islands fortunately in the early two zero zero zero s it was found sea level had fallen during preceding decades maldivians consider the introduction of islam in a d one one five three as the cornerstone of their country s history islam remains the state religion in the one nine nine zero s except for a brief period of portuguese occupation from one five five eight seven three maldives also has remained independent because the muslim religion prohibits images portraying gods local interest in ancient

religion of the people of maldives some scholars believe that the name maldives derives from the sanskrit maladvipa meaning garland of islands in the mid one nine eight zero s the maldivian government allowed the noted explorer and expert on early marine navigation thor heyerdahl to excavate ancient sites heyerdahl studied the ancient mounds called hawitta by the maldivians found on many of the atolls some of his archaeological discoveries of stone figures and carvings from pre islamic civilizations are today exhibited in a side room of the small national museum on mal heyerdahl s research indicates that as early as two zero zero zero b c maldives lay on the maritime trading routes of early egyptian mesopotamian and indus valley civilizations heyerdahl believes that early sun worshipping seafarers called the redin first settled on the islands even today many mosques in maldives face the sun and not mecca lending credence to this theory because building space and materials were scarce successive cultures constructed their places of worship on the foundations of previous buildings heyerdahl thus surmises that these sun facing mosques were built on the ancient foundations of the redin culture temples introduction of islam see also islam in maldives the interest of middle eastern peoples in maldives resulted from its strategic location and its abundant supply of cowrie shells a form of currency that was widely used throughout asia and parts of the east african coast since ancient times middle eastern seafarers had just begun to take over the indian ocean trade routes in the tenth century a d and found maldives to be an important link in those routes the importance of the arabs as traders in the indian ocean by the twelfth century a d may partly explain why the last buddhist king of maldives converted to islam in the year one one five three the king thereupon adopted the muslim title and name in arabic of sultan besides the old divehi title of maha radun or ras kilege muhammad al adil initiating a series of six islamic dynasties consisting of eighty four sultans and sultanas that lasted until one nine three two when the sultanate became elective the person responsible for this conversion was a sunni muslim visitor named abu al barakat his venerated tomb now stands on the grounds of hukuru mosque or miski in the capital of mal built in one six five six this is the oldest mosque in maldives arab interest in maldives also was reflected in the residence there in the one three four zero s of the well known north african traveler ibn battutah era of colonial powers portuguese in one five five eight the portuguese established themselves on maldives which they administered from goa on india s west coast fifteen years later a local guerrilla leader named muhammad thakurufaanu al azam organized a popular revolt and drove the portuguese out of maldives this event is now commemorated as national day and a small museum and memorial center honor the hero on his home island of utheemu on south thiladhummathi atoll dutch in the mid seventeenth century the dutch who had replaced the portuguese as the dominant power in ceylon established hegemony over maldivian affairs without involving themselves directly in local matters which were governed according to centuries old islamic customs however the british expelled the dutch from ceylon in one seven nine six and included maldives as a british protected area the status of maldives as a british protectorate was officially recorded in an one eight eight seven agreement in which the sultan accepted british influence over maldivian external relations and defense the british had no presence however on the leading island community of mal they left the islanders alone as had the dutch with regard to internal administration to continue to be regulated by muslim traditional institutions british during the british era from one eight eight seven to one nine six five maldives continued to be ruled under a succession of sultans the sultans were hereditary until one nine three two when an attempt was made to make the sultanate elective thereby limiting the absolute powers of sultans at that time a constitution was introduced for the first time although the sultanate was retained for an additional two one years maldives remained a british crown protectorate until one nine five three when the sultanate was suspended and the first republic was declared under the short lived presidency of muhammad amin didi this first elected president of the country introduced several reforms while serving as prime minister during the one nine four zero s didi nationalized the fish export industry as president he is remembered as a reformer of the education system and a promoter of women s rights muslim conservatives in mal eventually ousted his government and during a riot over food shortages didi was beaten by a mob and died on a nearby island beginning in the one nine five zero s political history in maldives was largely influenced by the british military presence in the islands in one nine five four the restoration of the sultanate perpetuated the rule of the past two years later the united kingdom obtained permission to reestablish its wartime airfield on gan in the southernmost addu atoll maldives granted the british a one zero zero year lease on gan that required them to pay two zero zero zero a year as well as some four four zero zero zero zero square metres on hitaddu for radio installations in one nine five seven however the new prime minister ibrahim nasir called for a review of the agreement in the interest of shortening the lease and increasing the annual payment but nasir who was theoretically responsible to then sultan muhammad farid didi was challenged in one nine five nine by a local secessionist movement in the southern atolls that benefited economically from the british presence on gan this group cut ties with the maldives government and formed an independent state with abdulla afif didi as president the short lived state one nine five nine six two called the united suvadivan republic had a combined population of two zero zero zero zero inhabitants scattered in the atolls then named suvadiva since renamed north huvadu and south huvadu and addu and fua mulaku in one nine six two nasir sent gunboats from mal with government police on board to eliminate elements opposed to his rule abdulla afif didi fled to the then british colony of seychelles where he was granted political asylum meanwhile in one nine six

nasir the second republic was proclaimed in november one nine six eight under the presidency of ibrahim nasir who had increasingly dominated the political scene under the new constitution nasir was elected indirectly to a four year presidential term by the majlis legislature he appointed ahmed zaki as the new prime minister in one nine seven three nasir was elected to a second term under the constitution as amended in one nine seven two which extended the presidential term to five years and which also provided for the election of the prime minister by the majlis in march one nine seven five newly elected prime minister zaki was arrested in a bloodless coup and was banished to a remote atoll observers suggested that zaki was becoming too popular and hence posed a threat to the nasir faction during the one nine seven zero s the economic situation in maldives suffered a setback when the sri lankan market for maldives main export of dried fish collapsed adding to the problems was the british decision in one nine seven five to close its airfield on gan in line with its new policy of abandoning defense commitments east of the suez canal a steep commercial decline followed the evacuation of gan in march one nine seven six as a result the popularity of nasir s government suffered maldives s two zero year period of authoritarian rule under nasir abruptly ended in one nine

of large ships which had become oil fired and therefore had no need to stop in the grand harbour of malta to refuel the british government had to extend the dockyard at the end of world war ii malta s strategic importance had reached a low point modern air warfare technology and the invention of the atomic bomb had changed the importance of the military base the british lost control of the suez

labor shortages have become more widespread despite illegal immigration and real earnings growth has accelerated growing public and private sector demand for credit has led in the context of interest rate controls to credit rationing to the private sector and the introduction of noninterest charges by banks despite these pressures consumer price inflation has remained low reflecting the impact of a fixed exchange rate policy and lingering price controls the maltese government has pursued a policy of gradual economic liberalization taking some steps to shift the emphasis in trade and financial policies from reliance on direct government intervention and control to policy regimes that allow a greater role for market mechanisms however by international standards the economy remains highly

marshall islands foreign relations by country mass deacidification is a term used in library and information science for one possible measure against the degradation of paper in old books the so called slow fires one technique proposed was to place books in an evacuated chamber then introduce diethyl zinc dez in theory the diethyl zinc would react with acidic residues in the paper leaving an alkaline residue that would protect the paper against further degradation in practice the heating required to remove trace water from the books before reaction dez reacts violently with water caused an accelerated degradation of the paper and a range of other chemical reactions between dez and other components of the book glues bindings caused further damage and the production of unpleasant smells regardless in the one nine eight zero s a pilot plant for mass deacidification using this process was constructed by nasa but it was discovered in one nine eight six that the dez had not been removed in one of the deacidification runs and was pooled in the bottom of the chamber and probably remained within some of the plumbing dez is violently flammable in contact with oxygen so the vacuum chamber could not be opened to remove the books within eventually explosives were used to rupture the suspect plumbing suspicions of the presence of residual dez were confirmed by the subsequent fire that destroyed the plant the chemical company akzo made later attempts at refining the process though the risks of fire and explosions were reduced by better process design damage and odours remained a problem in the end akzo decided the process was not a viable commercial proposition and shut down their research at the end of one nine nine four external links an loc paper on mass deacidification library and information science mass deacidification is a term used in the field of library and information science that refers to any large scale process designed to increase the ph of the paper of works printed on acidic paper from the one eight seven zero s to the one nine eight zero s most paper production methods resulted in paper that was acidic even though much acidic paper is still being produced worldwide cheaper paper production methods that produce alkaline paper have become predominant in paper manufacture in the united states acidic paper especially when exposed to light yellows and becomes brittle over time embrittlement can be prevented if the paper is deacidified there are currently three commercial mass deacidification methods the wei t o process the bookeeper process and the interleaf phase vapor process the wei t o process uses a magnesium carbonate complex to deacidify the paper the bookeeper method uses magnesium oxide to neutralize acidic paper the interleaf vapor phase process uses cyclohexamine carbonate to deacidify paper attempts to develop a commercially viable mass deacidification process using diethyl zinc have failed a mile is any of a number of units

python s flying circus it portrays a confrontation between disgruntled customer mr eric praline played by john cleese and a shopkeeper michael palin who hold contradictory positions on the vital state of a norwegian blue parrot an absurdity in itself since parrots are tropical and not indigenous to scandinavia the skit pokes fun at the many euphemisms for death used in english culture the sketch aired in the eighth episode of the television series the dead parrot sketch was inspired by a car salesman sketch that palin and graham chapman had done in how to irritate people in it palin played a car salesman who refused to admit that there was anything wrong with his customer s chapman car even as it fell apart in front of him that sketch was based on an actual incident between palin and a car salesman over the years cleese and palin have done many versions of the dead parrot sketch for various television shows record albums and live performances plot norwegian blue parrot pining for the fjords mr praline enters a pet shop complaining that the parrot he has recently purchased at the location is in fact dead the shopkeeper denies this and points out the beauty of its plumage further suggesting that the bird is merely asleep praline is unconvinced especially when shouting and the offer of a lovely fresh cuttlefish fails to evoke a response from the bird praline takes the parrot out of the cage and thumps its head on the counter then tosses it up in the air and watches it plummet to the floor without reacting in any way the shopkeeper remains unconvinced claiming that it is now stunned and that it is pining for the fjords praline points out that the only reason that the parrot had been sitting on its perch in the first place was that it had been nailed there the shopkeeper counters that it was simply to stop it escaping praline disagrees in these words mr praline it s not pinin it s passed on this parrot is no more it has ceased to be it s expired and gone to meet its maker this is a late parrot it s a stiff bereft of life it rests in peace if you hadn t nailed it to the perch it would be pushing up the daisies it s rung down the curtain and joined the choir invisible this is an ex parrot the shopkeeper admits defeat claims that he is right out of parrots and offers a slug as replacement the dialogue continues mr praline does it talk pause shopkeeper not really no mr praline well it s scarcely a replacement then is it the action then moves to bolton or possibly ipswich or maybe even notlob bolton spelled backwards much play is made of the location including the suggestion that the confusion between the towns is due to a pun or possibly a palindrome just as the dialogue is getting too silly graham chapman s no nonsense colonel bursts in and stops the sketch in and now for something completely different the skit ended by going into the lumberjack song in the secret policeman s biggest ball a benefit for amnesty international the sketch opens similarly but ends very differently mr praline it s dead that s what s wrong with it audience goes wild shopkeeper so it is ere s your money back and a couple of holiday vouchers mr praline spends a few seconds acting and looking flabbergasted well you can t say thatcher hasn t changed some things the dead parrot in popular culture palin and chapman in the car salesman sketch from how to irritate people at graham chapman s memorial service cleese began his eulogy by stating that graham chapman was no more that he had ceased to be that he had expired and gone on to meet his maker and so on cleese went on to justify his eulogy by claiming that chapman would never have forgiven him if he had not delivered it exactly as he did the same lines from the skit are frequently used to describe anything which the speaker wishes to describe as defunct or no longer viable the name dead parrot is also sometimes used and specifically applies to a controversial joint policy document which the liberal party and social democrats issued in one nine eight eight in the process of their merger into the liberal democratic party shortly before her downfall as prime minister margaret thatcher described this party in her deadpan comedy voice saying this is a dead parrot it has ceased to be the loss of the eastbourne parliamentary seat at a by election to the liberal democrats shortly afterward was cause for david steel its leader at the time to say it looks like this dead parrot gave her a good pecking the emblem of the liberal democrats is a flying yellow bird

is a famous sketch from monty python s flying circus it appears in episode three three salad days it is a fairly typical john cleese set piece in essence john cleese attempts to purchase some cheese from the cheese shop unfortunately the proprietor mr henry wensleydale michael palin as before playing the obstructive shopkeeper to cleese s irate customer appears to have not one single variety in stock not even a morsel of cheddar cheese the single most popular cheese in the world the slow crescendo of bouzouki music played by live musicians in the shop in the background mirrors cleese s growing anger as he lists various increasingly obscure cheeses to no avail the secondary punchline of this sketch is when john cleese who at the beginning said he wasn t annoyed by the music suddenly loudly interrupts the musicians and tells them to stop the main punchline of course is that there is no cheese in the shop when palin admits this fact cleese shoots him in the head in the television program the sketch is revealed to be a teaser for sam peckinpah s rogue cheddar this provides a link to further discussions of peckinpah films other versions the sketch was reworked for the brand new monty python bok becoming a two player word game in which one player the customer must keep naming different cheeses and the other player the shopkeeper must keep coming up with different excuses otherwise the customer wins and may punch the shopkeeper in the teeth the sketch was parodied in an episode of the young ones alexei sayle rushes into a shop also seeming to do a silly walk paying homage to the ministry of silly walks sketch and asks if it is a cheese shop rik mayall the palinesque proprietor replies no sir alexei says well that s that sketch knackered then innit the asian bride shop sketch in an episode of goodness gracious me also pays homage to the cheese shop sketch in that the characters are asian versions of cleese and palin and substitute the names of cheese types with descriptions of types of brides another pastiche was a script circulated on the internet in early two zero zero four which parodied the sco v ibm lawsuit in the script a judge taking cleese s role inquires of the palinesque attorney for the sco group as to the evidence he will be presenting for his suit only to discover after a monotonous line of questioning similar to the original sketch that sco has no evidence at all the script was a sharp parody of the quality of the sco lawsuit implying that it was exceedingly frivolous still another variation on the sketch appeared in the order of the stick a webcomic satirizing dungeons and dragons in this one the cheese shop is replaced by a polearm shop with the warrior roy greenhilt trying to get a replacement for his broken sword however this time the punchline is changed so that he is unable to assault the owner due to his lack of a suitable weapon the skit was also referenced in the weird al yankovic song albuquerque in this version the main character attempts to buy donuts at a donut shop with similiar results the scene ends when the shopkeeper reveals that all he has is a box of one dozen starving crazed weasels which the main character purchases opens and is then attacked by footnotes in the sketch itself palin refers to his character s name simply as mister wensleydale however the name henry wensleydale appears above the shop front in the series of stills that precede the original tv version of the sketch the list comes to a typically bizarre conclusion with cleese s desperate request for venezuelan beaver

university is not far away although the bruces sketch previously appeared in the tv show monty python s flying circus the song itself was original to the stage show the song s lyrics make a series of

as to whether the sixth line is both schopenhauer and hegel or just william friedrich hegel or whether it was eric hoffer or thomas hobbes who is described as being fond of his dram this is used as a drinking song among hash house harriers and rugby players save for hoffer if indeed he rather than hobbes is being cited all the thinkers whom the song mentions were dead by the time it appeared with

title used to refer to a monty python s flying circus comedy sketch also known by two other phrases that appear within it joke warfare and killer joke the premise of the sketch is fatal hilarity the joke is simply so funny that anyone who reads or hears it promptly dies laughing the sketch is set during world war ii when one ernest scribbler a struggling british writer creates the funniest joke in the world and then dies laughing his horrified mother played by eric idle enters clutching her chest and sobbing carefully taking the crumpled paper from his hand assuming it was a suicide note she reads it then falls over the desk laughing hysterically and dies further attempts to retrieve the joke are made one including an officer who declares he will enter the home aided by the sound of sombre music played on gramophone records and also by the chanting of laments by the men of q division unfortunately this is still not enough to stop the joke from killing the officer it is finally retrieved by the british army and after careful testing the joke is translated into german for use on the battlefield because the joke is so lethal translators are only allowed to work on one word each a translator who accidentally saw two words had to be hospitalised for two months it replaces an earlier failed joke stock footage of neville chamberlain holding the infamous munich agreement the nonsensical german translation of the joke including words that are not real german wenn ist das nunst ck git und slotermeyer ja beiherhund das oder die flipperwaldt gersput the joke is so successful

monty python sketches jokes the spanish inquisition was one of the most popular monty python sketches the principal catchphrase in this sketch was nobody expects the spanish inquisition http people csail mit edu paulfitz spanish tt two jpg image nobody in their right mind could have expected this form of spanish inquisition in which the inquisitors proceed to use such extremities of torture as poking with soft cushions and forcible seating in a comfy chair as a means of forcing a heretic a housewife to recant this inquisition has a hard time starting to inquisit as they get bogged down in recitations of their chief weapons among which are such diverse elements as fear surprise ruthless efficiency an almost fanatical devotion to the pope and nice red uniforms listen this was a recurring sketch always predicated by an unrelated sketch in which one character expressing irritation at being questioned by another would announce i didn t expect a kind of spanish inquisition at this point the inquisition consisting of cardinal ximinez michael palin cardinal biggles terry jones and cardinal fang terry gilliam would burst into the room ximinez would shout with a particular and high pitched emphasis on the first syllable no body expects the spanish inquisition one of the sketch s features was that ximinez s blood thirsty bluster ran into the problem of not being able to produce the desired tortures when he called for the rack his assistants immediately produced a dish drying rack after expressing his frustration with a furious clench toothed grin ximinez was barely able to seriously order the victim to be tied to the rack and interrogated when poking the victim with soft cushions produced no confession ximinez would inquire whether his assistants had gotten all the stuffing together into one end of the cushions for supposed maximum effectiveness in the original monty python s flying circus tv episode episode one five the spanish inquisition makes several unexpected appearances until at the very end of the show they were caught by surprise as the closing credits roll the inquisitors race to where they weren t expected only to arrive just as the words the end appear ximinez crying nobody expects the sp oh bugger which incidentally was a strong word for a bbc comedy show at the time and some bbc regions omitted it from the broadcast its influence this sketch may have been an inspiration for the inquisition portion of the movie history of the world part i nobody expects the spanish inquisition appeared as a fictional crossover in a batman comic

latin manu scriptus written by hand strictly speaking is any written document that is put down by hand in contrast to being printed or reproduced some other way information may be hand recorded in other ways than in manuscripts as inscriptions that are chiselled upon a hard material or scratched the original meaning of graffiti as with a knife point in plaster or with a stylus on a waxed tablet the way romans made notes or are in cuneiform writing impressed with a pointed stylus in a flat tablet of unbaked clay in southeast asia in the first millennium documents of sufficiently great importance were inscribed on soft metallic sheets such as copperplate softened by refiner s fire and inscribed with a metal stylus in the philippines for example as early as nine zero zero ce specimen documents were not inscribed by stylus but were punched much like the style of today s dot matrix printers this type of document was rare compared to the usual leaves and bamboo staves that were inscribed however neither the leaves nor paper were as durable as the metal document in the hot humid climate in myanmar the kammavaca buddhist manuscripts were inscribed on brass copper or ivory sheets and even on discarded monk robes folded and lacquered in italy some important etruscan texts were similarly inscribed on thin gold plates similar sheets have been discovered in bulgaria technically these are all inscriptions rather than manuscripts thus it will be seen that manuscripts are not defined by their contents which may combine writing with mathematical calculations maps explanatory figures or illustrations manuscripts may be in the form of scrolls or in book form or codex format illuminated manuscripts are enriched with vignettes border decoration elaborately engrossed initial letters and full page illustrations manuscripts in history the traditional abbreviations are ms for manuscript and mss for manuscripts the second s by the way is not simply the plural but by an old convention doubles the last letter of the abbreviation to express the plural just as pp means pages before the invention of printing by inked carved blocks in china or by moveable type in a printing press in europe all written documents had to be both produced and reproduced by hand historically manuscripts were produced in form of scrolls volumen in latin or books codex codices manuscripts were produced on vellum and other parchments on papyrus and on paper in russia birch bark documents as old as from the one one th century have survived when greek or latin works were published numerous professional copies were made simultaneously by scribes in a scriptorium each making a single copy from an original that was declaimed aloud the oldest manuscripts have been preserved by the perfect dryness of their resting places whether placed within sarcophagi in egyptian tombs or reused as mummy wrappings discarded in the middens of oxyrhyncus or secreted for safe keeping in jars and buried nag hammadi library or stored in dry caves dead sea scrolls manuscripts in tocharian languages written on palm leaves survived in desert burials in the tarim basin of central asia manuscripts preserved in volcanic ash preserve some of the greek library of the villa of the papyri in herculaneum ironically the manuscripts that were being most carefully preserved in the libraries of antiquity are all lost the study of the writing or hand in surviving manuscripts is termed palaeography in the western world from the classical period through the early centuries of the christian era manuscripts were written without spaces between the words scriptio continua which makes them especially hard for the untrained to read extant copies of these early manuscripts written in greek or latin and usually dating from the four th century to the eight th century are classified according to their use of either all upper case or all lower case letters manuscripts using all upper case letters are called uncials those using all lower case are called cursives early hebrew manuscripts such as the dead sea scrolls make no such differentiation manuscripts today according to library and information science a manuscript is defined as any hand written item in the collections of a library or an archive for example a library s collection of the letters or a diary that some historical personage wrote in other contexts however the use of the term manuscript no longer necessarily means something that is hand written by analogy a typescript has been produced on a typewriter in book magazine and music publishing a manuscript is an original copy of a work written by an author or composer which generally follows standardized typographic and formatting rules in film and theatre a manuscript or script for short is an author s or dramatist s text used by a theater company or film crew during the production of the work s performance or filming more specifically a motion picture manuscript is called a screenplay a television manuscript is called a teleplay and a manuscript for the theater is called a stage play in insurance a manuscript policy is one that is

or strong prejudice against men misogyny is usually regarded as directed against women by some men though women can also hold misogynistic views in feminist theory misogyny is recognized as a political ideology similar to racism or anti semitism that justifies and maintains the subordination of women by men the word comes from the greek misos hatred gyne woman forms of misogyny there are many different forms of misogyny in its most overt expression a misogynist will openly hate all women simply because they are female some sexual predators may fall into this category other forms of misogyny may be more subtle some misogynists may simply be prejudiced against all women or may hate women who don t fall into one or more acceptable categories entire cultures may be said to be misogynist if they treat women in ways that can be seen as harmful examples include forcing women to tend to all domestic responsibilities demanding silence from a woman or beating a woman regularly subscribers to one model the mother whore dichotomy hold that women can only be mothers or whores another variant is the virgin whore dichotomy in which women who do not adhere to a saintly standard of moral purity are considered whores frequently the term misogynist is used in a looser sense as a term of derision to describe anyone who holds an unpopular or distasteful view about women as a group a man who considers himself a great lover of women therefore might somewhat paradoxically be termed a misogynist by those who consider his treatment of women sexist archetypes of this type of man might be giacomo casanova a historical figure or james bond and don juan fictional characters who were both reputed for their many libertine affairs with women while a seducer like casanova or don juan might appear outwardly charming and to enjoy the company of women many do not at root respect women or find them interesting on any higher plane than mere sex objects many men whom feminists would regard as misogynists are merely distrustful of women as a sex but trusting and loving towards indivdual women misogyny in philosophy and religion many religions and philosophies contain what could be called misogyny paul insisted that women should not talk in church women should remain silent in the churches they are not allowed to speak but must be in submission as the law says one cor one four three four niv in hinduism the code of manu makes women incapable of ever being independent at times in indian history it was customary for a woman to be pushed onto the funeral pyre of her husband see sati in islam some interpretations of sharia law forbid women to show any part of their body in public except their face hands or the top of their feet there is however wide disagreement from followers of these religions that these various teachings are misogynistic the one six th century protestant reformer john knox wrote a book called the first blast of the trumpet against the monstrous regiment of women in which he argued against the ability of women to govern some of the most famous philosophers exhibited misogyny at times arthur schopenhauer in a very sophisticated epistemological discussion in his main work included the sentence reason is feminine in nature it can only give after it has received nietzsche is known for arguing that every higher form of civilisation implied stricter controls on women beyond good and evil seven two three eight he frequently insulted women but is best known for the phrases women are less than shallow woman was god s second blunder and are you going to women do not forget the whip napoleon machiavelli aristotle tolstoy and even the progressive rousseau were also known for making such comments about women it should also be noted however that philosophers such as pythagoras john stuart mill friedrich engels fyodor dostoyevsky and henry george supported feminism misogyny in language many slang terms that refer to women are considered offensive by some women such terms have existed throughout history and change over time some of those common in contemporary usage are babe a diminutive or familiar way to address a woman more commonly said to a partner in a similar way to honey bird british english most women see it as demeaning also commonly used in modern ireland where it is not considered very demeaning chick literally a young chicken or young bird of any kind this term is mildly offensive to some women who interpret it to be infantilizing or objectifying it is chiefly an americanism it is sometimes claimed that the usage derives from the spanish chica girl but neither the oxford english dictionary nor merriam webster supports this derivation the word chick was used in a gender neutral sense to mean human child at least as early as the one four th century the popularity of the usage in north america may nonetheless be due in part to its similarity to the spanish word sheila used in australia becoming outdated in favour of more american terminologies skeezer used in some hip hop recordings in some cultural groups terms considered extremely offensive to most women e g bitch cunt or ho are used to refer to women in general many terms that refer to women s physical appearance e g hottie a sexually attractive woman see wide use but many consider them to imply sexual objectification

country in northwest africa its coast faces the atlantic ocean on the west with senegal on the south west mali on the east and south east algeria on the north east with the moroccan annexed territory of western sahara on the north west the capital and largest city is nouakchott located on the atlantic coast it is named after the ancient berber kingdom of mauretania history from the three rd to seven th centuries the migration of berber tribes from north africa displaced the bafours the original inhabitants of present day mauritania and the ancestors of the soninke the bafours were primarily agriculturalist among the first saharan people to abandon their historically nomadic lifestyle with the gradual desiccation of the sahara they headed south following them came a migration of not only central saharans into west africa but berbers and arabs as well by the eleventh century ad the once small bafour people had grown into a very large and wealthy soninke empire ghana which stretched from mauritania into the neighboring states of senegal and mali likewise in the north the arab berber population had achieved an impressive empire of their own the territory of which stretched across the mediterranean into spain and portugal local nomadic berber tribes on the other hand though influential remained largely without power having been conquered by the soninke in one zero seven six islamic warrior monks almoravid or al murabitun attacked and conquered the ancient ghana empire over the next five zero zero years arabs overcame fierce resistance from the local population berber and non berber alike and came to dominate mauritania the mauritanian thirty year war one six four four seven four was the unsuccessful final effort to repel the yemeni maqil arab invaders led by the beni hassan tribe the descendants of the yemeni beni hassan warriors became the upper stratum of moorish society berbers retained influence by producing the majority of the region s marabouts those who preserve and teach islamic tradition many of the berber tribes proclaimed the origin of yemen as they sometimes did an arab one there is yet little evidence to suggest this though some studies do link a connection between the two hassaniya a mainly oral berber influenced arabic dialect that derives its name from the yemeni beni hassan tribe became the dominant language among the largely nomadic population aristocrat and servant castes developed yielding white moors the aristocracy kewri the indigenous peoples who were never enslaved and black moors or haratin the formerly enslaved french colonization at the beginning of the two zero th century brought legal prohibitions against slavery and an end to interclan warfare during the colonial period the population remained nomadic but many sedentary peoples whose ancestors had been expelled centuries earlier began to trickle back into mauritania as the country gained independence in one nine six zero the capital city nouakchott was founded at the site of a small colonial village the ksar and nine zero of the population was still nomadic with independence larger numbers of the indigenous peoples haalpulaar soninke and wolof entered mauritania moving into the area north of the senegal river educated in french language and customs many of these recent arrivals became clerks soldiers and administrators in the new state moors reacted to this change by increasing pressure to arabize many aspects of mauritanian life such as law and language a schism developed between those who consider mauritania to be an arab country mainly moors and those who seek a dominant role for the non moorish peoples the discord between these two conflicting visions of mauritanian society was evident during intercommunal violence that broke out in april one nine eight nine the one nine eight nine events but has since subsided the tension between these two visions remains a feature of the political dialogue a significant number from both groups however seek a more diverse pluralistic society politics mauritania s presidential election its third since adopting the democratic process in one nine nine two took place on november

political power dependent upon control over resources perceived ability or integrity and tribal ethnic family and personal considerations conflict between white moor black moor and non moor ethnic groups centering on language land tenure and other issues continues to be the dominant challenge to national unity the government bureaucracy is composed of traditional ministries special agencies and parastatal companies the ministry of interior spearheads a system of regional governors and prefects modeled on the french system of local administration under this system mauritania is divided into one three regions wilaya including the capital district nouakchott control is tightly concentrated in the executive branch of the central government but a series of national and municipal elections

territory of western sahara in one nine seven six with mauritania taking the lower one third after several military losses to polisario mauritania retreated in one nine seven nine and their claims were taken by morocco due to economic weakness mauritania has been a negligible player in the territorial dispute with its official position being that it wishes for an expedient solution that is

military coup led by colonel ely ould mohamed vall ended maaouya ould sid ahmed taya s two one years long strong arm rule applauded by the mauritanian people but cautiously watched by the

mauritanian military including members of the presidential guard seized control of key points in the capital of nouakchott they took advantage of president maaouya ould sid ahmed taya s attending of

forces and security forces have unanimously decided to put a definitive end to the oppressive activities of the defunct authority which our people have suffered from during the past years bbc the military council later issued another statement naming its president colonel ely ould mohamed vall and listing one six other officers as members widely applauded by the mauritanian population the coup was at first cautiously watched by the international community although it was afterward quickly normalized israel s recognition by the islamic republic of mauritania was maintained by the new regime the colonel mohamed vall was himself once regarded as a firm ally of the now ousted president sid ahmed taya even aiding him in the original coup that brought him to power and serving as his security chief afterwards this high level betrayal of the former president suggests broad discontent within the branches of local government which is further supported by the lack of bloodshed and the population s support of the rebel militaries ely ould mohamed vall s military council august two zero zero five normalization of the coup the coup was at first condemned by most world authorities but local political parties expressed hope that the military council would remain true to its word and end its leadership after two years according to mohammed vall s promise hopefully leading to a civil government in immediate response to the coup and in keeping with their own rules the african union suspended mauritania from all organizational activities on august one zero the united states and the african union dropped demands that the coup be reversed however the african union did not reverse the suspension citing a need for elections before re admittance mohammed vall s military council issued a decree prohibiting all current military men or civilians in authority from holding office in the projected new government a proposed constitutional amendment would limit the president to two

of the islamic republic of mauritania dates back to the three rd century mauritania is named after the ancient berber kingdom of mauretania pre colonization from the three rd to seven th century the migration of berber tribes from north africa displaced the bafours the original inhabitants of present day mauritania and the ancestors of the soninke continued arab berber migration drove indigenous black africans south to the senegal river or enslaved them by one zero seven six islamic warrior monks almoravid or al murabitun completed the conquest of southern mauritania defeating the ancient ghana empire over the next five zero zero years arabs overcame fierce berber resistance to dominate mauritania the mauritanian thirty year war one six four four seven four was the unsuccessful final berber effort to repel the maqil arab invaders who were led by the beni hassan tribe the descendants of beni hassan warriors became the upper stratum of moorish society berbers retained influence by producing the majority of the region s marabouts those who preserve and teach islamic tradition hassaniya a mainly oral berber influenced arabic dialect which derives its name from the beni hassan tribe became the dominant language among the largely nomadic population aristocrat and servant castes developed yielding white moors aristocracy and black moors the enslaved indigenous class french colonization french colonization at the beginning of the two zero th century brought legal prohibitions against slavery though at the end of the two zero th century rural slavery persisted and an end to interclan warfare during the colonial period the population remained nomadic but sedentary black africans whose ancestors had been expelled centuries earlier by the moors began to trickle back into southern mauritania independence under ould daddah as the country gained independence on november two eight one nine six zero the capital city nouakchott was founded at the site of a small colonial village the ksar while nine zero of the population was still nomadic with independence larger numbers of ethnic sub saharan africans haalpulaar soninke and wolof entered mauritania moving into the area north of the senegal river educated in french language and customs many of these recent arrivals became clerks soldiers and administrators in the new state moors reacted to this change by increasing pressures for arabization to arabicize many aspects of mauritanian life such as law and language a schism developed between those who considered mauritania to be an moorish arab country and those who seek a dominant role for the sub saharan peoples the moorish community remained in charge of the state apparatus president moktar ould daddah originally installed by the french formalized mauritania into a one party state in one nine six four with a new constitution which set up an authoritarian presidential regime daddah s own parti du peuple mauritanien ppm became the ruling

polisario front the country s economic and political stability began to crumble despite french and moroccan military aid polisario raids against the zouerate railway and mines threatened to bring about economic collapse and there were deep misgivings in the military about the saharan venture ethnic unrest contributed to the disarray black africans from the south were conscripted as front line soldiers after the northern sahrawi minorities and their moorish kin had proven unreliable in the fight against polisario but many of the southerners rebelled against having to fight what they
